The module function is to acquire data from mobile phone built-in sensors, apply conditions on these data, and trigger a response when these conditions are satisfied. The user can identify which sensor, condition and response to be used. UCML application has been designed to be friendly, easy-to-use, natural-understanding language that is suitable for sensor-interested mobile phone users. Google's Android is the chosen platform to be the underlying operating system for UCML. This paper proposes the On-Device Development approach (ODD) and discusses some technologies and tools that have influenced the development of UCML.

Such specifications do then fulfill given requirements, such as timing constraints or safety properties. However, the problem of automatically implementing the actual control programs has received much less attention, and one of the reasons for this is that industrial controllers necessarily have to be able to effectively handle every conceivable situation that might occur in reality, which make the construction of the specification very difficult. In this preliminary report, we take one step towards automatic generation of control systems by proposing that not only the control program should be synthesized from a specification, but also an execution monitor that is able to detect and classify discrepancies between the model of the closed-loop system and the actual effects of control actions.

By analyzing the interpersonal structure and the unique characteristics of a community in OSNs, we show that the number of friends, the quality of friends, and the community label, are three key factors to a user's community influence which means a user's social influence in a community.

Proceedings of the 1999","20020806","1999","1","","554","556 vol.1","In the framework of the HERA Luminosity Upgrade Project it is foreseen to move the final focus quadrupole magnets of the proton machine 16 m closer to the interaction region. As the electrons must not be affected by these magnets, the beam pipes for electrons and protons have to be well separated at these magnets. This implies rather sharp bends with bending radii down to 360 m for the electron orbit in the interaction region. At an electron energy of 30 GeV and a beam current of 58 mA these bends cause a high level of synchrotron radiation. The synchrotron radiation will be guided through the interaction region and will be absorbed far downstream at low power densities. However, it is unavoidable to stop parts of the synchrotron radiation beam at high linear power densities of up to 2 kW/cm rather close to the interaction point where the electron and proton vacuum systems are separated. In order to protect the proton final focus magnet and the septum beam pipe from this synchrotron radiation, a high power synchrotron radiation absorber was designed. This absorber not only has to withstand the heat load of the synchrotron radiation, but it also has to be designed to minimize the backward scattering of the radiation, because these scattered photons might hit sensitive detector components in the interaction region. This paper will first give an overview of the geometry of the interaction region with special emphasis on the synchrotron radiation. Then the geometrical and thermal requirements for the high power absorber will be described and finally the layout of the absorber will be presented","","0-7803-5573-3;0780355733","","10.1109/PAC.1999.795758","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=795758","","Electromagnetic scattering;Electron beams;Magnets;Particle beams;Particle scattering;Power system protection;Protons;Radiation detectors;Synchrotron radiation;Vacuum systems","colliding beam accelerators;electron accelerators;proton accelerators;shielding;storage rings;synchrotron radiation","HERA Luminosity Upgrade Project;beam pipes;electron orbit;final focus quadrupole magnets;high power synchrotron radiation absorber;interaction region;proton vacuum systems;synchrotron radiation;synchrotron radiation beam","","2","","3","","","1999","27 Mar 1999-02 Apr 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops message-passing de-quantization (MPDQ) algorithms for minimum mean-squared error estimation of a random vector from quantized linear measurements, notably allowing the linear expansion to be overcomplete or undercomplete and the scalar quantization to be regular or non-regular. The algorithm is based on generalized approximate message passing (GAMP), a recently-developed Gaussian approximation of loopy belief propagation for estimation with linear transforms and nonlinear componentwise-separable output channels. For MPDQ, scalar quantization of measurements is incorporated into the output channel formalism, leading to the first tractable and effective method for high-dimensional estimation problems involving non-regular scalar quantization. The algorithm is computationally simple and can incorporate arbitrary separable priors on the input vector including sparsity-inducing priors that arise in the context of compressed sensing. Moreover, under the assumption of a Gaussian measurement matrix with i.i.d. entries, the asymptotic error performance of MPDQ can be accurately predicted and tracked through a simple set of scalar state evolution equations. We additionally use state evolution to design MSE-optimal scalar quantizers for MPDQ signal reconstruction and empirically demonstrate the superior error performance of the resulting quantizers. In particular, our results show that non-regular quantization can greatly improve rate-distortion performance in some problems with oversampling or with undersampling combined with a sparsity-inducing prior.","1053-587X;1053587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2217334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295675","Analog-to-digital conversion;Slepian-Wolf coding;Wyner-Ziv coding;approximate message passing;belief propagation;compressed sensing;frames;non-regular quantizers;overcomplete representations;quantization","AC-DC converters;Approximation algorithms;Compressed sensing;Estimation;Linear systems;Quantization;Transforms","Gaussian processes;approximation theory;belief networks;compressed sensing;mean square error methods;measurement systems;message passing;quantisation (signal)","GAMP;Gaussian approximation;Gaussian measurement matrix;MPDQ algorithms;MPDQ signal reconstruction;MSE-optimal scalar quantizers;asymptotic error performance;compressed sensing;generalized approximate message passing;high-dimensional estimation problems;incorporate arbitrary separable priors;linear expansion;linear transforms;loopy belief propagation;measurements scalar quantization;message-passing dequantization algorithms;minimum mean-squared error estimation;nonlinear componentwise-separable output channels;nonregular scalar quantization;output channel formalism;quantized linear measurement;random vector;scalar quantization;scalar state evolution equations;simple linear techniques;sparsity-inducing prior;sparsity-inducing priors;vector estimation","","28","","58","","2012-09-05","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The position control of the slider is the key technique in the servo presses. In order to achieve an excellent position control performance of the slider, a position servo control strategy of the slider in a servo press - double toggle mechanical press is proposed in this paper. The control strategy combines the Bezier curve model and the fuzzy control methods. Firstly, the controlled mechanical object is described. Then, a Bezier curve model is established to accurately describe the control curves. Based on this Bezier curve model, the position servo control given curves of the crank for different processes are obtained. Afterwards, transverse flux machine (TFM) is selected as the servo motor for the control system because of its high force densities. Since TFM has complex nonlinear features, a Fuzzy-Proportional-Integral (fuzzy-PI) control method is presented to control the crank position for tracking the given curves. At last, the tracking curves for different processes are obtained. The results show that the control strategy can effectively achieve the flexible manufacturing of the press.","2161-8070;21618070","978-1-4577-1730-7;9781457717307","978-1-4577-1731-4;9781457717314","10.1109/CASE.2011.6042424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042424","","Equations;Optimization;Position control;Presses;Process control;Servomotors","PI control;curve fitting;flexible manufacturing systems;forging;fuzzy control;industrial control;position control;presses;pressing;servomechanisms","Bezier curve model;control strategy;control system;crank curves;crank position control;curve tracking;double toggle mechanical press;flexible manufacturing;force density;forming process;fuzzy-PI control;fuzzy-proportional-integral control;nonlinear feature;servo press;servomotor;slider position servo control;transverse flux machine","","3","","16","","","24-27 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is able to ingest real-time data from different ionosondes, providing the ionospheric bottomside plasma frequency ƒ<inf>p</inf> over the Italian area. The model is constructed on the basis of empirical values for a set of ionospheric parameters P<inf>i[base]</inf> over the considered region, some of which are assigned a variation ΔP<inf>i</inf>. The values for the ionospheric parameters actually observed at a given time at a given site will thus be P<inf>i</inf>= P<inf>i[base]</inf>+ΔP<inf>i</inf>. These P<inf>i</inf> values are used as input of an electron density N(h) profiler. The latter is derived from the Advanced Ionospheric Profiler (AIP), which is software used by Autoscala as part of the process of automatic inversion of ionogram traces. The 3D model ingests ionosonde data by minimizing the root-mean-square deviation between the observed and modeled values of ƒ<inf>p</inf>(h) profiles obtained from the associated N(h) values at the points where observations are available. The ΔP<inf>i</inf> values are obtained through such a minimization procedure. The 3D model is tested using data collected at the ionospheric stations of Rome (41.8 N, 12.5 E) and Gibilmanna (37.9 N, 14.0 E), and then comparing the results against data from the ionospheric station of San Vito dei Normanni (40.6 N, 18.0 E).

The architecture uses integrated Doppler sensors that allows for vehicle detection and help complete the power efficiency objective. Thus, when a vehicle is detected the light intensity of the lamps is increased to a preset level, so as not to affect road traffic safety, and reduced in the opposite case. Moreover, the system uses current sensors so as to allow for the identification of any possible malfunctions and thus facilitate the maintenance process. According to the obtained results, the system allows for an increased performance level and can be integrated in the Smart City concept.","","","","10.1109/ICEPE.2014.6969994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6969994","Smart City;WSN;large-scale;street lighting control","Lighting;Lighting control;Logic gates;Monitoring;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","electric sensing devices;lamps;lighting control;road safety;road traffic;street lighting;wireless sensor networks","current sensors;electric power;field testing;integrated Doppler sensors;large-scale WSN;light intensity;maintenance costs;power efficiency;remote control;road traffic safety;smart city;street lighting control system;street lighting lamps;street lighting monitoring;vehicle detection","","0","","7","","","16-18 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the process of platform specific optimization, software pipeline, loop unrolling and writing liner assembly code is fulfilled. With these enhancements, we show in experimental results that the implemented system can detect human faces in real-time at a frame rate of 25 fps with little loss of correct detection rate. In our implementation, we further decrease the false detection rate, and dramatically reduce memory bandwidth and memory size required.","","978-0-7695-3825-9;9780769538259","","10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341671","Adaboost;DSP;face detection;real time","Assembly;Bandwidth;Computational complexity;Digital signal processing;Face detection;Humans;Image converters;Pipelines;Real time systems;Writing","digital signal processing chips;face recognition","Adaboost algorithm;DSP-based platform;TMS320DM642;face detection;loop unrolling;optimized cascade training;software pipeline","","0","","4","","","25-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Measurements using a vibrating sample magnetometer show a monotonic enhancement of coercivity from 600 to 1500 Oe with increasing Cr thickness. Media noise was measured as a function of transition density using a spectrum analyzer. The media noise power at 2400 flux changes per millimeter decreased by a factor of about 10 with the increase in Cr thickness. This reduction is accompanied by a reduction in the coercivity squareness and the development of granular features in CoNiCr grains growing on the columns of the Cr underlayer.

Previous approaches to key-based error control required either an asymptotically large field or an impractically long key.

An example is the McGurk effect, in which people viewing a speaker whose lip movements do not match the utterance perceive the spoken sounds incorrectly, hearing them as more similar to those signaled by the visual rather than the auditory input. This indicates that audiovisual integration is important for generating the phoneme percept. Here we asked when and where the audiovisual integration process occurs, providing spatial and temporal boundaries for the processes generating phoneme perception. Specifically, we wanted to separate audiovisual integration from other processes, such as simple deviance detection. Building on previous work employing ERPs, we used an oddball paradigm in which task-irrelevant audiovisually deviant stimuli were embedded in strings of non-deviant stimuli. We also recorded the event-related optical signal, an imaging method combining spatial and temporal resolution, to investigate the time course and neuroanatomical substrate of audiovisual integration. We found that audiovisual deviants elicit a short duration response in the middle/superior temporal gyrus, whereas audiovisual integration elicits a more extended response involving also inferior frontal and occipital regions. Interactions between audiovisual integration and deviance detection processes were observed in the posterior/superior temporal gyrus. These data suggest that dynamic interactions between inferior frontal cortex and sensory regions play a significant role in multimodal integration.</para>","0898-929X;0898929X","","","10.1162/jocn_a_00812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226565","","","","","","0","","","","","Aug. 2015","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

From mid-90's, the mainline railway management has undergone revamps to revitalize the intra-modal competitiveness of railway transportation and to steer it toward the direction of modern business management. With the rapid economic growth; the large-scale expansion of the mainline network; and the increasing expectation on service, the mainline railways in China require further restructuring. Inevitably, a sustainable approach to ensure business viability and service quality in the next few decades is an imminent challenge. This paper reviews the operations and management of mainline railway in China and discusses the possibility of introducing open access market. Drawing the experiences on railway open markets outside China, the discussions include the need and feasibility of railway open market in China; and the suitability and limitations of different models. Particular considerations will be given to the unique characteristics of the mainline railways in China, where the developments across neighbouring regions are unbalanced; freight and passenger services are of similar demands; and the high-speed train operations are operated with low-speed ones in mixed traffic.","","","","10.1049/ic.2010.0044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5552103","mainline railways in China;open market;railways operation","","locomotives;railways","China;high-speed train;mainline railways;open markets;railway management;railway transportation","","0","","","","","13-15 April 2010","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

The recovery of the vertical component of fluid motion from a monocular sequence of image observations is a very challenging problem for which no solution exists in the literature. Based on a physically sound vertical decomposition of the atmosphere into cloud layers of different altitudes, we propose here a dense motion estimator dedicated to the extraction of 3-D wind fields characterizing the dynamics of a layered atmosphere. Wind estimation is performed over the complete 3-D space, using a multilayer model describing a stack of dynamic horizontal layers of evolving thickness, interacting at their boundaries via vertical winds. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated on synthetic and real sequences.","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.918167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4558036","3-D winds;Atmospheric measurements;image sequence analysis;inverse modeling;motion analysis;variational methods","","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric movements;atmospheric techniques;image sequences;motion estimation;wind","3D atmospheric fluid flows;3D motion estimation;3D winds;atmospheric layers;atmospheric measurements;dense motion estimator;image sequences;inverse modeling;motion analysis;variational methods","","9","","24","","2008-07-09","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents the hardware implementation of the RNN model. Recently, cognitive packet networks (CPN) is proposed as an alternative packet network architecture where there is no routing table, instead the RNN based reinforcement learning is used to route packets. Particularly, we describe implementation details for the RNN based routing engine of a CPN network processor chip: the smart packet processor (SPP). The SPP is a dual port device that stores, modifies, and interprets the defining characteristics of multiple RNN models. In addition to hardware design improvements over the software implementation such as the dual access memory, output calculation step, and reduced output calculation module, this paper introduces a major modification to the reinforcement learning algorithm used in the original CPN specification such that the number of weight terms are reduced from 2n<sup>2</sup> to 2n. This not only yields significant memory savings, but it also simplifies the calculations for the steady state probabilities (neuron outputs in RNN). Simulations have been conducted to confirm the proper functionality for the isolated SPP design as well as for the multiple SPP's in a networked environment.","1045-9227;10459227","","","10.1109/TNN.2003.816366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1243716","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer architecture;Engines;Hardware;Learning;Neural networks;Recurrent neural networks;Routing;Software algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;packet switching;probability","cognitive packet networks;dual access memory;packet switched networks;random neural networks;reinforcement learning;routing engine;routing table;smart packet processor;spiked neural network model;steady state probability","","9","","16","","","Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most programmable network processors on the market today, such as the Intel IXP2800, target relatively low performance (from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps). However, low cost edge routers will find it hard to cope with the forthcoming sophistication of network applications to be processed at those speeds. Hence, new architectures should be designed for the programmable network processors of the future. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of Simultaneous MultiThreaded (SMT) as the base architecture of a network processor. Indeed, the SMT model inherently allows the multiple parallel threads which must be dealt with in network processor applications. In this paper, we investigate the architectural implications of network applications on the SMT architecture. We demonstrate that, when executed as independent threads, applications chosen from different network layers show an improved Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) and cache behavior when compared with the situation where the program executed comes from a single network application. Finally, a new architectural solution to cope with packet dependency is proposed and evaluated.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2009.185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374374","Packet dependency;network processor;simultaneous multithreading.","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Data mining;IP networks;Program processors;Synchronization","Internet;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","Intel IXP2800;Internet traffic;cache architectural solution;computation-intensive network applications;instructions per cycle;low cost edge router;programmable network processors;simultaneous multithreading processor","","2","","36","","2010-01-08","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Benign faults, such as crashes and message omissions, are nevertheless the standard assumption in practical fault-tolerant distributed systems. Algorithms tolerant to arbitrary faults are harder to understand and more expensive to deploy (requiring more machines). In this work, we introduce a non-malicious arbitrary fault model including transient and permanent arbitrary faults, such as bit flips and hardware-design errors, but no malicious faults, typically caused by security breaches. We then present a compiler-based framework that allows benign fault-tolerant algorithms to automatically tolerate arbitrary faults in non-malicious settings. Finally, we experimentally evaluate two fundamental algorithms: Paxos and leader election. At expense of CPU cycles, transformed algorithms use the same number of processes as their benign fault-tolerant counterparts, and have virtually no network overhead, while reducing the probability of failing arbitrarily by two orders of magnitude.","","978-1-4673-5746-3;9781467357463","","10.1109/LADC.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542613","Byzantine faults;algorithm transformation;arbitrary faults;fault tolerance;hardware errors","Computer crashes;Distributed algorithms;Encoding;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Transforms","computer centres;fault tolerant computing","Paxos algorithm;arbitrary fault tolerance;benign fault;bit flip;commodity-hardware data center;crash fault;fault tolerant distributed system;hardware design error;leader election algorithm;message omission fault;nonmalicious arbitrary fault model;permanent arbitrary fault;transient arbitrary fault","","4","","33","","","1-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"On multiset decipherable codes (Corresp.)","A. Lempel","","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","20030106","1986","32","5","714","716","In certain applications it is necessary to communicate a description of a sequence of events where the information of interest is which one of a set of possible events has occurred, including multiplicity, but where the order of occurrence is irrelevant. Typical examples are online compilations of inventories, construction of histograms, or updating of relative frequencies. Suitable codes for this purpose need not be uniquely decipherable (UD). In fact, all that is required of such a code is that given a finite message over the code, every possible parsing of the message into codewords must yield the same multiset of codewords. A code with this property is referred to as a multiset decipherable (MSD) code. An MSD code is said to be proper if it is not a UD code. It is shown that for every <img src=""/images/tex/4823.gif"" alt=""n > 3""> there exist proper MSD codes with <img src=""/images/tex/23.gif"" alt=""n""> words.

The topology of MBRNN as well as its initial weights are defined according to the linearized state-space model of the plant. As such, the MBRNN has the ability to incorporate the analytical knowledge of the plant in its formulation. With its original topology intact, the MBRNN can then be trained to represent the plant nonlinearities through modifying its node activation functions, which consist of contours of Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs). Training involves adjusting the weights of the RBFs so as to modify the contours representing the activation functions. The performance of the MBRNN is demonstrated via several examples. The results indicate that it requires much shorter training than needed by ordinary recurrent networks. This training efficiency is attributed to the MBRNN's fixed topology, which is independent of training","","0-7803-5446-X;078035446X","","10.1109/CCA.1999.801236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=801236","","Artificial neural networks;Gallium nitride;Industrial engineering;Industrial training;Network topology;Neural networks;Power system modeling;Recurrent neural networks;State-space methods;Uncertainty","learning (artificial intelligence);linearisation techniques;modelling;nonlinear dynamical systems;recurrent neural nets;state-space methods;transfer functions","Gaussian radial basis function contours;MBRNN;RBF weight adjustment;linearized state-space model;model-based recurrent neural network topology;node activation functions;nonlinear dynamic system modeling;plant nonlinearities","","0","","19","","","1999","22 Aug 1999-27 Aug 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is therefore not possible to evaluate every wafer: commonly, a small subset of a productive lot is measured at the metrology station and delegated to represent the whole lot. Virtual Metrology (VM) methodologies aim to obtain reliable estimates of metrology results without actually performing measurement operations; this goal is usually achieved by means of statistical models, linking process data and context information to target measurements. In this paper, we tackle two of the most important issues in VM: (i) regression in high dimensional spaces where few variables are meaningful, and (ii) data heterogeneity caused by inhomogeneous production and equipment logistics. We propose a hierarchical framework based on ℓ<sub>1</sub>-penalized machine learning techniques and solved by means of multitask learning strategies.

In the state of art approach, the AGC loop adjustment is based on the measurement of the received signal power. This measurement can be made directly from the RF unit or after the ADC.

While the detection method is based on the novel concept of Low Transient Pulse (LTP), the overall system implementation utilizes two microelectronics technologies: Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The DSP carries out the analysis of the received signal at a much lower rate hence can accommodate a large number of signal channels. The FPGA runs at a higher frequency (62.5MHz) to generate the LTP signal and to calculate the envelope of the received signal (sampled at 1MHz). This research elaborates on designing a Quadrature AM (QAM) demodulator on the FPGA for the received signal from the ultrasound and for the detection of the presence of edges/fracture on the test materials. The complete system is designed and optimized in a high level MatlabSimulink fixed point simulation. Different sub-blocks are then implemented and optimized on the FPGA where efforts are taken to maintain its accuracy with the simulated model. In this work, the technology is applied to determine the location of the Sawbone plate edges based on the received signals which are then passed through a QAM demodulator in the FPGA and a peak detector in the DSP to calculate the echo peak times.","2163-5137;21635137","978-1-4244-6390-9;9781424463909","","10.1109/ISIE.2010.5636657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636657","","Acoustics;Digital signal processing;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IIR filters;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Transient analysis","demodulators;design engineering;digital signal processing chips;field programmable gate arrays;fracture;logic design;mathematics computing;peak detectors;plates (structures);quadrature amplitude modulation;ultrasonic applications","MatlabSimulink;Sawbone plate edge;digital signal processor design;echo peak time;field programmable array design;low transient pulse;peak detector;quadrature AM demodulator;real-time fracture detection;ultrasound signal","","0","","28","","","4-7 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Neutronic analysis using ANISN code has been conducted to assess tritium breeding capability, shielding performance, and nuclear power generation. Heat transfer for the Pb-17Li streams has been calculated considering MHD pressure loss to be acceptable. Temperature distribution in the F82H vessel and SiC<sub>f</sub>/SiC cooling panel has been calculated using ANSYS Version 10.0. The results show that the maximum temperature of the F82H does not exceed 550degC with He flow velocity of 60 m/s. The thermal-hydraulic evaluations of heat transfer media based on the experimental data shows that the overall heat transfer coefficient between SiC and Pb-17Li in the blanket is estimated to 650-800 W/m<sup>2</sup>K.","1078-8891;10788891","978-1-4244-2635-5;9781424426355","978-1-4244-2636-2;9781424426362","10.1109/FUSION.2009.5226508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226508","SiC<inf>f</inf>/SiC;blanket design;component;lithium-lead;overall heat transfer coefficient","Conducting materials;Cooling;Extrapolation;Heat transfer;Helium;Magnetohydrodynamics;Nuclear power generation;Performance analysis;Silicon carbide;Temperature distribution","fusion reactor blankets;heat transfer;lead alloys;lithium alloys;nuclear engineering computing;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;tritium handling","ANISN code;ANSYS version 10.0;F82H vessel material;MHD pressure loss;PbLi;SiC cooling panel;heat transfer coefficient;high temperature extraction;high temperature lithium-lead blanket;magnetohydrodynamic pressure;neutronic analysis;nuclear power generation;plasma facing components;shielding performance;thermal-hydraulic evaluation;tritium breeding capability","","1","","12","","","1-5 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing work study the problem from two aspects, i.e. secure key division/distributed storage and secure distributed authentication. But existing cheating problems and fault attack possibility will break the security. Besides, efficiency performance of such schemes is not good enough due to the exponential arithmetic with Shamir's scheme. Due to these problems above, we explore the property of verifiable secret sharing(VSS) schemes with Chinese Remainder Theorem(CRT). Then a secret key distributed storage scheme based on CRT-VSS and trusted computing is proposed for MANET. We utilize trusted computing technology to solve two existing cheating problems in secret sharing area before. After that we do some analysis of the homomorphism property with CRT-VSS scheme. Compared with the secure shares-product sharing scheme based on Shamir's scheme, we design the corresponding scheme base on CRT-VSS scheme with better concision and equal security later. On such basis, a distributed Elliptic Curve-Digital Signature Standard signature (ECC-DSS) authentication scheme based on CRT-VSS scheme and trusted computing is proposed. The choice of the trusted authentication node can eliminates the possibility of traditional DoS and fault attack.

To this end, a digital video is first divided into various frames consisting of several blocks which are transformed by discrete wavelet transform. Spread spectrum incorporated with just notice difference is utilized to embed the watermark into the feature blocks or nonfeature blocks.

We achieve this by using a message-passing optimization procedure, specially tailored for this problem, that operates on a bipartite graph with nodes corresponding to fibers and voxels. New estimates of fiber strength allow derivation of new measures for quantifying anatomical connections between large gray matter regions.

We consider the case of multispectral images in which we have observed images of the same zone through different spectral bands. The land cover types existing in the scanned zone constitute the sources to separate. Associating each source to a specific significant theme remains the real challenge in the source-separation method applied to satellite images. In fact, multispectral images consist of multiple channels, each channel containing data acquired from different bands within the frequency spectrum. Since most objects emit or reflect energy over a large spectral bandwidth, there usually exists a significant correlation between channels. This constitutes the first difficulty for sources identification. The second difficulty lies in the heterogeneity of most of the geological and vegetative ground surfaces. In this case, the geometrical projection of a single detector element at the Earth's surface, which is sometimes called the instantaneous field of view, is formed from a mixture of spectral signatures. In such circumstances, the needed information is either not available or not reliable. In this paper, the goal is to establish a new approach based on a two-level source separation (TLSS), which consists of a spectral separation along the different used bands and a spatial separation along neighboring pixels of each image band. The spectral separation has been used prior to the Bayesian approach, and it is based on a second-order statistics approach that exploits the correlation through different spectral bands of the multispectral sensor. The given images are represented according to independent axes that provide more effective representation of the information within the observation images. The spectral separation consists of identifying the sources without resorting to any a priori information, hence the term blind. The obtained source- - s represent the starting point for the Bayesian approach, which is known for its weakness in front of initial conditions. To identify a significant theme for each source, we have to spatially separate each image based on a Bayesian source-separation framework. The proposed approach has the added advantages of the blind source method as well as the Bayesian method. It should give segmented images related to each theme covering the scanned zone, which are the TLSS results of the observation images","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.882261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4014321","Bayesian estimation;blind source separation;multispectral image classification","Bandwidth;Bayesian methods;Blind source separation;Detectors;Frequency;Geology;Multispectral imaging;Remote sensing;Satellites;Source separation","Bayes methods;blind source separation;image classification;remote sensing","Bayesian estimation;blind source separation;geological ground surface;land cover types;multispectral image classification;remote sensing;second-order statistics;spatial source separation;spectral source separation;two-level source separation;vegetative ground surface","","6","","31","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The International Conference on Program Comprehension is one of the leading conferences in the area of program understanding, software analysis, reverse engineering, software evolution, and software visualization. Over the years, the ICPC conference has provided a lively forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government, to present and discuss both the state-of-the-art and the state-of-thepractice in the general area of program comprehension. For the 15th year in the life of this event, we have arranged a very exciting four-day program. We received 66 submissions and based on over 200 review reports from 45 Program Committee members and another 50 external reviewers, we have selected 22 full-length and 4 short papers for presentation at the conference. In addition to the technical-paper sessions, we also have a tool demonstration session, held jointly with the VISSOFT workshop, which is collocated with ICPC this year. Furthermore, this year's program includes three working sessions. The first reflects on the evolution of our field and community through the past 15 years, and where we are headed next; the second examines the role that empirical methods play in evaluating our techniques; and, the third session examines the challenges that aspect orientation introduces to our research. Last, but certainly not least, we are particularly thrilled to feature two stimulating keynote addresses from Gregor Kiczales, of the University of British Columbia, and Mark Harman, of King's College London. Over the years, Kiczales' work on aspect-oriented design and programming and Harman???s work on slicing and search-based software engineering methods have been very influential in shaping the systems we develop and the analyses we conduct on them.","1092-8138;10928138","0-7695-2860-0;0769528600","","10.1109/ICPC.2007.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268230","","","","","","0","","","","","26-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While in open areas the quality of the Global Positioning System (GPS) service is typically acceptable, in partially obstructed environments, such as urban canyons, or indoor, it could be either unavailable or hindered by very coarse and unacceptable estimates. Moreover, most of the proposals for overcoming these limitations could be unsuitable in emergency scenarios. We propose a localization and tracking system based on the combined usage of WiFi and GPS. Essentially, when the GPS coverage is scarce, our localization solution allows augmenting it by using the WiFi access points as virtual satellites. When GPS coverage is not available at all, we use WiFi trilateration based on received signal strength, even maintaining the same coordinate system used in the GPS. The tracking protocol makes use of session initiation protocol messaging over a WiFi network. The proposed system is characterized by ease of deployment and usage, since it does not require any particular configuration. In order to assess its feasibility, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype made up of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components and open-source software. The performance tests carried out by using this prototype confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2462742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7210149","GNSS;IEEE 802.11;session initiation protocol (SIP);tracking;trilateration;virtual satellite","Global Positioning System;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Protocols;Receivers;Satellite broadcasting;Satellites;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-08-19","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper comparatively studied two feature extraction methods for image description, i.e., the Gabor wavelet transform and the Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients (PHOG). The Gabor transform has been widely adopted to extract image features for various vision tasks. PHOG has the superiority in its description of more discriminating information. A highly reliable classification scheme was proposed by cascade classifier ensembles with reject option to accommodate the situations where no decision should be made if there exists adequate ambiguity. The first ensemble is heterogeneous, consisting of several classifiers, including <i>k</i>-nearest neighbors (kNNs), multiple-layer perceptrons (MLPs), support vector machines (SVMs), and random forest. The classification reliability is further enhanced by a second classifier ensemble, which is composed of a set of base MLPs coordinated by an ensemble metalearning method called rotation forest (RF). For both of the ensembles, rejection option is accomplished by relating the consensus degree from majority voting to a confidence measure and by abstaining to classify ambiguous samples if the consensus degree is lower than a threshold. The final class label is assigned by dual majority voting from the two ensembles. Experimental results using more than 600 images from a variety of 21 makes of cars and vans demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The cascade ensembles produce consistently reliable results. With a moderate ensemble size of 25 in the second ensemble, the two-stage classification scheme offers 98.65% accuracy with a rejection rate of 2.5%, exhibiting promising potential for real-world applications.","1524-9050;15249050","","","10.1109/TITS.2012.2213814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295662","Classification reliability;Gabor transform;Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients (PHOG);classification with rejection;rotation forest (RF) ensemble;vehicle-type classification","Accuracy;Erbium;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Reliability;Transforms;Vehicles","Gabor filters;feature extraction;gradient methods;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;road vehicles;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing;wavelet transforms","Gabor wavelet transform;MLP;PHOG;RF;SVM;cascade classifier;feature extraction methods;for image description;image feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors;kNN;meta learning method;multiple layer perceptrons;pyramid histogram of oriented gradients;reliable classification;rotation forest;support vector machines;vehicle type recognition","","7","","48","","2012-09-05","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, such applications will frequently come across communication and node failures which can affect both their performance and consistency. Therefore, there is a need for techniques which will allow applications to tolerate such failures and continue to provide expected services. A common technique is through the use of atomic transactions, which ensure that only consistent state changes take place despite concurrent access and failures. However, they may be insufficient to guarantee forward progress. This can be accomplished by replicating resources, so that the failure of a subset of replicas can be masked from users.

They also typically require the installation of proprietary software on the end user system which is an obstacle for deployment in learning scenarios at universities. Facing these challenges when bringing the Chemical Engineering WebLabs at the University of Cambridge online, the Computing Center of the University of Stuttgart and the University of Cambridge developed a framework to allow the secure deployment of industrial controller software in remote learning applications; this framework is generic, has a low-barrier for students as it only requires an internet browser and Java™ installation, and it satisfies the high security demands of most university infrastructure providers.

Keslassy","Technion, Israel","IEEE Transactions on Computers","20100826","2010","59","10","1378","1391","Most common network protocols transmit variable size packets, whereas contemporary switches still operate with fixed- size cells, which are easier to transmit and buffer. This necessitates packet segmentation and reassembly modules, resulting in significant computation and communication overhead that might be too costly as switches become faster and bigger. It is, therefore, imperative to investigate an alternative mode of scheduling in which packets are scheduled contiguously over the switch fabric. This paper investigates the cost of packet-mode scheduling for the combined input-output-queued (CIOQ) switch architecture. We devise frame-based schedulers that allow a packet-mode CIOQ switch with small speedup to mimic an ideal output-queued switch, with bounded relative queuing delay. The schedulers are pipelined and based on matrix decomposition. Our schedulers demonstrate a trade-off between the switch speedup and the relative queuing delay incurred while mimicking an output-queued switch. When the switch is allowed to incur high relative queuing delay, a speedup arbitrarily close to two suffices to mimic an ideal output-queued switch. This implies that packet-mode scheduling does not require higher speedup than a cell-based scheduler. The relative queuing delay can be significantly reduced with just a doubling of the speedup. We further show that it is impossible to achieve zero relative queuing delay (that is, a perfect emulation), regardless of the switch speedup. In addition, simpler algorithms can mimic an output-queued switch with a bounded buffer size, using speedup arbitrarily close to one. Simulations confirm that packet-mode emulation with reasonable relative queuing delay can be achieved with moderate speedup. Furthermore, a simple and practical heuristic is shown by simulations to also provide effective packet-mode emulation.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2009.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374375","Internetworking;packet-switching networks;routers;sequencing and scheduling.","Communication switching;Computer architecture;Costs;Delay;Emulation;Fabrics;Packet switching;Processor scheduling;Protocols;Switches","matrix decomposition;packet switching;protocols;scheduling","bounded relative queuing delay;cell-based scheduler;frame-based schedulers;input-output-queued switch architecture;matrix decomposition;network protocols;packet segmentation;packet-mode CIOQ switch;packet-mode emulation;packet-mode scheduling;reassembly modules","","5","","34","","2010-01-08","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Distributed generation (DG) units can minimize the burden on transmission networks by supplying local loads and providing ancillary services. However, increased penetration of DG units in the distribution networks require new operating conditions to ensure safe and secure system operation. This concern appears during the operation of small to medium-scale low and medium voltage micro/smart grids. This paper investigates the fault - ride through capability (FRT) of the DGs with and without storage. It also discusses the difference between the base case without DGs and after adding DG units to the system when the system experiences a transient fault. The fault - ride through capability is studied on a generic model of IEEE distributed generation system with 13 buses. To assess the fault - ride through capability, the test network is simulated by using the commercial DIgSILENT Power Factory, and results obtained are discussed.","","","","10.1109/ICRERA.2013.6749917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6749917","Fault ride through;Photovoltaic;Renewable energy;Storage;Transient;Wind","Distributed power generation;Photovoltaic systems;Reactive power;Renewable energy sources;Time-frequency analysis;Transient analysis","distributed power generation;energy storage;load flow;power apparatus;power distribution faults;power supply quality;power system security;renewable energy sources;smart power grids","DG;FRT;IEEE 13 bus distributed generation system;commercial DIgSILENT Power Factory;distribution network;medium voltage microsmart grid;medium-scale low microsmart grid;power flow;power quality problem;power system safety;power system security;renewable energy;transient fault-ride through;transmission network equipment","","0","","9","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scott","","Proceedings of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","20130913","1918","37","7","779","792","Reference is made to propaganda against processes for making nitrates from air by those interested in keeping the Allies dependant on supplies of nitrate from Chili. A tabular comparison is made of the operations involved in the indirect method and the direct method of fixing nitrogen. The indirect method involves the manufacture of carbide of calcium and its combination with nitrogen to form calcium cyanimid, from which ammonia and in turn nitric acid are obtained. The direct method merely consists in combining nitrogen and oxygen of the air in the electric arc. In the direct method electric energy is the only factor, whereas by the indirect much plant of a very diverse and complicated character is required. Also there are difficulties in connection with the platinum catalyst necessary to convert ammonia into nitric acid. It is claimed that the direct method is better because of the simplicity of plant and of operation, and the possibility of working with off peak power. The suggestion is made that a number of plants for making nitrates by the direct arc process should be erected at existing power houses. Keeping the generating plant more fully employed would improve the power factor and reduce costs. By making nitrate in a number of centers the transportation of same to the explosive factories would be reduced and the risk of interruption of supplies in case of accident or sabotage would be less than in having a few very large factories. A diagram is given showing the layout of a battery of by-product coke ovens with an electric power house worked by the surplus gas and a nitrate from air plant to use the electricity. Figures are given showing that the nitric acid made by such a plant is about the right amount to combine with the ammonia to form ammonium nitrate, a compound in great demand at the present time for explosives.","0097-2444;00972444","","","10.1109/PAIEE.1918.6591987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6591987","","Absorption;Calcium;Explosives;Fires;Furnaces;Nitrogen","","","","0","","","","","July 1918","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed method is mainly based on the fact that if the video bitrate has been increased with the help of video editing software, its essential video quality will not increase at all. By analyzing the quality of the questionable video and a series of its re-encoded versions with different lower bitrates, we can obtain a feature curve to measure the change of the video quality, and then we propose a compact feature vector (3-D) to expose fake bitrate videos and their original bitrates.

(CAMAD '94) Fifth IEEE International Workshop on","20020806","1994","","","0_8","0_8","Bursty communication channels can be modeled as hidden Markov sources where the error source is assumed to exist in one of N states and the source alphabet consists of M symbols. In general the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of a stationary source is given by P, the N x N state.,transition matrix. The N states are partitioned into M sets such that when the source is in a state belonging to set i, symbol i is generated. HMMs provide great flexibility to the design engineer in interpreting the symbols and the states. In general HMM techniques can be an invaluable tool for channel characterization. The problem with existing techniques is that they are computationally intensive and it is usually impossible to use them in real time applications. In many cases, the existing methods also give non unique models since they tend to use either too many or too few parameters in their model structures. Our main contribution is a highly efficient HMM algorithm that can be used in real time channel tracking applications. The method we use integrates our technique for estimating an equivalent (and in a number of cases, unique) model A with the forward-only procedure developed by Narciso Tan et.al. The resulting algorithm is used on an ""improve the model as you go"" basis to provide for real time channel tracking. Using empirical modeling techniques for the channel response, we generate observation sequences and then evaluate the performance of our channel tracking algorithm. The algorithm is being implemented on a C40 based development platform to test its real time applicability.","","","","10.1109/CAMAD.1994.765628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=765628","","Communication channels;Design engineering;Hidden Markov models;Testing","","","","0","","","","","24-27 April 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yau (1990) presented a new filtering system that uses a new direct method to solve nonlinear filtering systems with arbitrary initial condition; this system is called the Yau filter. The Yau filter guarantees that the final solutions will converge for any assumption of initial distribution. Therefore, the Yau filtering system is powerful and the realization of the Yau filtering system is valuable. We present a circuit system for solving the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the Yau filter. The Runge-Kutta method is used to create the data flow structure for the circuit system.

The main objective of the proposed control strategy of each distributed generation (DG) unit is to compensate the reactive power of its local loads and to share the reactive power of the nonlocal loads among itself and other DG units. The proposed control strategy includes an improved droop controller whose parameters are adjusted according to the reactive power of the local loads. A virtual inductive impedance loop is augmented to the voltage controller to enhance the steady state and transient responses of the proposed reactive power management scheme. The small signal analysis of the proposed method is presented to ensure stability of the system for different reactive power values. The presented strategy considerably enhances the voltage profiles of the microgrid buses as compared with the conventional droop methods. The proposed method does not require any communication link and minimizes the reactive power flow in the MV lines, thus reducing the losses of the overall microgrid. The performance of the proposed control scheme is verified by using digital time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.","0840-8688;08408688","","","10.1109/CJECE.2013.6544468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544468","distributed generation;droop controller;multi-bus MV microgrid;reactive power management;self-adjusting controller","Control systems;Frequency control;Impedance;Inverters;Microgrids;Reactive power;Voltage control","decentralised control;distributed power generation;power distribution control;power system management;reactive power;self-adjusting systems","DG units;MV lines;PSCAD/EMTDC software environment;control strategy;decentralized self-adjusting control strategy;decentralized self-adjusting reactive power controller;digital time-domain simulation;distributed generation;droop controller;islanded multibus MV microgrid;multibus medium voltage;reactive power flow;reactive power management;signal analysis;steady state;transient responses;virtual inductive impedance loop;voltage controller;voltage profiles","","7","","","","","Winter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"A Neural Model for Compensation of Sensory Abnormalities in Autism Through Feedback From a Measure of Global Perception","G. Noriega","RMS Instrum. Ltd., Mississauga, ON","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","20080805","2008","19","8","1402","1414","Sensory abnormalities and weak central coherence (WCC), a processing bias for features and local information, are important characteristics associated with autism. This paper introduces a self-organizing map (SOM)-based computational model of sensory abnormalities in autism, and of a feedback system to compensate for them. Feedback relies on a measure of balance of coverage over four (sensory) domains. Different methods to compute this measure are discussed, as is the flexibility to configure the system using different control mechanisms. Statistically significant improvements throughout training are demonstrated for compensation of a simple (i.e., monotonically decreasing) hypersensitivity in one of the domains. Fine-tuning control parameters can lead to further gains, but a standard setup results in good performance. Significant improvements are also shown for complex hypersensitivities (i.e., increasing and decreasing through time) in two domains. Although naturally best suited to compensate hypersensitivities-stimuli filtering may mitigate neuron migration to a hypersensitive domain-the system is also shown to perform effectively when compensating hyposensitivities. With poor coverage balance in the model akin to poor global perception, WCC would be consistent with inadequate feedback, resulting in uncontrolled hyper- and/or hyposensitivities characteristic of autism, as seen in the topologies of the resulting SOMs.","1045-9227;10459227","","","10.1109/TNN.2008.2000447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4560236","Autism;self-organizing maps (SOMs);sensory abnormalities;weak central coherence (WCC)","","biology computing;self-organising feature maps","autism;computational model;feedback system;fine-tuning control parameters;global perception;hypersensitive domain;hypersensitivity compensation;neural model;neuron migration;self-organizing map;sensory abnormalities;stimuli filtering;weak central coherence","Autistic Disorder;Cognition;Feedback;Humans;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Neuronal Plasticity;Sensation;Sensation Disorders","1","","31","","2008-07-15","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Static conditions include static and uniform background, identical poses, similar illumination, neutral frontal face. Non static conditions include position, partial occlusion orientation, varying lightening conditions and facial hair which make recognition process a complex problem. All these factors influence face recognition process. The main stages for face recognition include face detection, feature representation and classifications.

A track is a two-dimensional (2D) or a three-dimensional (3D) signal in time where each point of the signal is the x and y (and z) centroid spatial coordinate of an object at a specific frame of the video. The track may be generated by the movement of a vehicle, person, or object. In the 2D case, the signal is decomposed into x and y time series for use in one-dimensional time series segmentations. Then the results of the two segmentations are combined to produce a 2D signal segmentation of the track which results in unique events to be labeled. The Procrustes measure, from shape analysis, is employed along with template matching to find the most likely trajectory of each individual event. Once each event is labeled with a semantic description from the template, we enhance the label using other basic measurements based on the track. The application of our framework on 4 vehicle tracks from original videos is shown to display the efficacy of our method.","1522-4880;15224880","978-1-4244-5653-6;9781424456536","978-1-4244-5655-0;9781424456550","10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5413671","image shape analysis;shape measurement;signal resolution;time series","Computer vision;Global Positioning System;Labeling;Shape measurement;Signal resolution;Time series analysis;Tracking;Two dimensional displays;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Video sequences","time series;video signal processing","2D signal segmentation;Procrustes measure;semantic labeling;shape analysis;template matching;time series segmentation;track events","","2","","6","","","7-10 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, under ambient conditions without stringent environment control, nanomanipulation tasks are difficult to complete because various system drift can cause uncertainties of the spatial relationship between the AFM probe tip and the nano-entities to be manipulated. Researchers have speculated that thermal drift is one of the major causes of errors for nanomanipulation using AFM systems, but to this date, quantitative analyses of AFM drift phenomenon are almost non-existent. This paper gives a detection and analyses method for AFM operating-drift based on automated sequential image processing, which provides a quantitative understanding of the AFM drift phenomenon. Essentially, the drift of an AFM system can be measured by a Phase-Correlation Method among consecutively scanned images. In order to eliminate the effects of z-direction drifts in x, y displacements, a gradient calculation method is introduced. The influence of a PZT actuator's thermal expansion on overall system drift is also analyzed. The results showed that although the length of the PZT actuator's expansion is the greatest among all the main system components, it may not be the main cause of the overall system drift.","1944-9399;19449399","978-1-4244-0607-4;9781424406074","978-1-4244-0608-1;9781424406081","10.1109/NANO.2007.4601295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601295","Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM);automated sequential image processing;automatic nanomanipulation;manipulation drift","Atomic force microscopy;Control systems;Image analysis;Image processing;Nanotechnology;Object detection;Probes;Robotics and automation;Thermal expansion;Uncertainty","atomic force microscopy;gradient methods;image sequences;nanotechnology;piezoelectric actuators","AFM probe tip;PZT;PZT actuator;atomic force microscopy;automated sequential image processing;drift detection;gradient calculation method;nanoimaging;nanomanipulation;phase correlation method;thermal expansion","","0","","8","","","2-5 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Safety in medical signal analysis","A. F. Kohn; S. S.

An example is the use of a filter to attenuate interference when the (unidimensional) signal of interest contains wavelets. The output wavelets may be distorted by the filter in such a way that their interpretation leads to an incorrect diagnosis. In medical imaging, peripheral hot spots and sunburst streaking in computed tomography, blurring of tomographic reconstruction of cardiac images (as in single-photon-emission computed tomography, or SPECT) due to organ movement, and artifact due to image enhancement are among the difficulties introduced by signal analysis methodology. Some general recommendations are put forward as to how to deal with these kinds of problems.<<ETX>>","0739-5175;07395175","","","10.1109/51.107170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=107170","","Art;Biomedical equipment;Biomedical imaging;Distortion;Filters;Image analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Safety;Signal analysis;Testing","cardiology;computerised picture processing;computerised tomography;medical diagnostic computing;radioisotope scanning and imaging","SPECT;artifact;cardiac images;computed tomography;erroneous results;filter;image enhancement;inadequate decision;incorrect diagnosis;interference attenuation;medical imaging;medical signal analysis;organ movement;output wavelets;peripheral hot spots;safety;single-photon-emission computed tomography;sunburst streaking;tomographic reconstruction blurring;unidimensional signal","","0","","4","","","Dec. 1991","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Rendering aspects, like multi-texturing and 3D augmented videos are discussed in detail. The determination of the positions of the visitors is achieved by processing the images of a camera fixed on the room's ceiling. Combined with the stereo front-facing cameras, we show how occlusions between the real person and the virtual man can be handled. The system works in real-time on a single machine with three video input streams and two graphic outputs","","0-7695-0846-4;0769508464","","10.1109/ISAR.2000.880920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880920","","Cameras;Computer graphics;Educational institutions;Legged locomotion;Mirrors;Real time systems;Rendering (computer graphics);Space technology;Streaming media;Videos","art;augmented reality;exhibitions;hidden feature removal;image texture;optical projectors;rendering (computer graphics);stereo image processing;video cameras;video signal processing","3D augmented videos;artistic exhibition;augmented man;augmented stereo videos;behavioural coding;cameras;emotions;graphic outputs;multi-texturing;new media technology;occlusions;question-asking;real-time system;rendering;talking;video input streams;virtual man;visitor position determination;wall projection screen","","1","","6","","","2000","05 Oct 2000-06 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Until recently propane vehicles have commonly used a vapor pressure system, wherein the propane would be vaporized and mixed with combustion air in the intake plenum of the engine. This leads to lower efficiency as more air, rather than fuel, is inducted into the cylinder for combustion. The developed system has been uniquely engineered and represents the latest generation in automotive LPG fuel systems. By injecting LPG into the engine as a liquid rather than a vapor, the system improves engine volumetric efficiency, producing more power from less fuel and achieving improved fuel consumption and less pollution. All the main components of the system are introduced and described as well as the most significant experimental results obtained. The system has been positively tested on various ICE vehicles and it will be also validated on two hybrid prototypes which are under development by Italian consortiums of small and medium enterprises in the framework of national R&D programs.","2163-5137;21635137","978-1-4673-5194-2;9781467351942","","10.1109/ISIE.2013.6563827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563827","Alternative Fuels;Direct Injection LPG Systems;Extended Range Electric Vehicles;Sustainable Mobility","Batteries;Engines;Ice;Liquids;Petroleum;Vehicles","","","","0","","12","","","28-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major obstacles to precision accelerometry are the nonlinear dynamics of the ESG rotor and parametric variation of the ESG electronics. We derive a model for the ESG dynamics with an eye toward efficient representation of the uncertainties in the model. We represent the model uncertainties and nonlinearities in a framework amenable to μ-analysis and analyze ESG accelerometer precision using μ-analysis tools.

Contrary to the consensus in the chemistry society, the problem of whether DNA is conducting or insulating remains to be hotly debated among physics groups due to the disparate experimental results varying from conductor to insulator. The study of DNA electronic properties requires an efficient way to accurately position and individually manipulate DNA molecules. The recent development of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based nano-robotics seems to be a promising solution. In this research, the DNA molecules are positioned onto a pair of electrodes by a nano-robotic tool.

Ensuring safety and high performance of an ICD is essential. However, much needed reference standards for the assessment of safety and efficacy of ICDs have not been defined in Korea. In this study, ICD issues were investigated, including product characteristics and permission status, to provide grounds for test items, establish methods and standards in testing and assessing the safety and performance of ICDs, which conform to international standards. Relevant documents such as those pertaining to domestic standards and FDA guidance were analyzed. Moreover, safety and performance assessment items, test standards, and test methods were successfully formulated in conformity with international standards by test validation of the proposed test methods.

While much of the industry is currently focused on packaging LED technology in standardized 19<sup>th</sup> century form factors to address the massive installed base of traditional fixtures, the unique characteristics of solid state devices can and will be exploited to produce new luminaire types and new paradigms in lighting design for the 21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond. Since operating temperatures directly impact energy efficiency, output spectrum, and product lifetime, thermal management is a key linkage in the interdependence of application requirements, design trade-offs, and performance characteristics. This paper details the design of a high-power, high-density LED-based light source for large-scale lighting applications. In particular, a low-profile folded-fin copper heat sink was designed for forced-convection cooling by an array of 38 mm × 38 mm fans. Heat sink dimensions, including fin thickness, fin spacing, heat sink length, and heat sink base thickness to fin height ratio, were varied within form factor constraints and manufacturing limits to produce a suitable thermal solution for a 60,000+ lumen, 50.8 mm × 50.8 mm LED array dissipating 600 W of heat. Results of numerical, analytical, and experimental investigations demonstrate that LED junction temperatures can be maintained below maximum operating limits in a 45°C ambient.","1087-9870;10879870","","","10.1109/ITHERM.2014.6892263","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892263","Air Cooling;Light Emitting Diode;Solid State Lighting;Thermal Management","Heat sinks;Heating;Junctions;Light emitting diodes;Lighting;Thermal conductivity;Thermal resistance","LED lamps;fans;forced convection;heat sinks;light sources","LED based light source;fan;forced convection cooling;forced convection heat sink parametric design;high density LED array;high power LED array;large scale lighting application;light emitting diode;lighting industry;low profile folded fin copper heat sink;low profile heat sink parametric design;size 38 mm;solid state light source;temperature 45 C","","0","","15","","","27-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The potential of these technologies for e-government applications at Los Angeles County are analyzed. The government model for leveraging Internet technologies is different from that of commercial enterprises or academia. Thus immediate utilization of seemingly attractive technological opportunities must be tempered by organizational, implementation and social responsibility constraints. Application mashups are regarded as a good business opportunity for the County, and content syndication offers a convenient way for the County to share and disseminate information to the public. However, appropriate attention needs to be paid to issues such as loss of ownership control and authenticity of the final products. Wikis, blogs and social networking require more resources for implementation and present a variety of legal and control problems. The main conclusion drawn is that Web 2.0 presents an interesting opportunity for local governments such as Los Angeles County but that there should not be a headlong rush to implementation without consideration of a variety of other issues.","","978-1-4244-5344-3;9781424453443","978-0-7695-3805-1;9780769538051","10.1109/CONGRESS.2009.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341713","Web 2.0;application mashups;content syndication;e-government;efficiency","Blogs;Business;Electronic government;Internet;Law;Legal factors;Local government;Mashups;Social network services;Tagging","Internet;information dissemination;local government;social aspects of automation","Internet technology;Los Angeles County;Web 2.0;academia;application mashups;business opportunity;commercial enterprises;e-government;electronic user audience;information dissemination;local governments;municipal level;social responsibility constraints","","1","","9","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fifteenth Annual IEEE","20020806","2000","2","","932","938 vol.2","A new hybrid pulse width modulator (HPWM) is suggested. It provides (a) extended linearity (up to modulation index of 1.154), (b) reduced switching losses, and (c) less annoying acoustic noise by changing the current spectrum. The spectrum is modified by changing randomly the ratio of the durations of the application of the two zero-state vectors, V<sub>0</sub> and V<sub>7</sub>. Such a way to modify the current spectrum is effective at modulation indices up to m&les;0.8. A new method that provides additional capability of controlling the spectrum for m>0.8, and thus the emitted acoustic noise from the drive, is proposed and investigated. The method extends the HPWM with an additional algorithm which randomly selects the PWM carrier frequency as either f<sub>carr</sub> or 2·f<sub>carr</sub>. The extra losses, which normally result in an increase of the average switching frequency, are avoided by dropping one of the zero-vector states for m>0.8. This corresponds to using a discontinuous modulation function. The transition between the different operation modes is seamless and the method is easy to implement due to the HPWM structure. Simulation results and experiments validate the usefulness of the method proposed","","0-7803-5864-3;0780358643","","10.1109/APEC.2000.822801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=822801","","Acoustic noise;Acoustic pulses;Automation;Frequency synchronization;Linearity;Pulse width modulation;Sampling methods;Space vector pulse width modulation;Switching frequency;Switching loss","PWM invertors;acoustic noise;induction motor drives;losses;noise abatement;switching circuits","PWM carrier frequency;PWM-VSI drives;acoustic noise;average switching frequency;discontinuous modulation function;emitted acoustic noise;extended linearity;hybrid random pulse width modulator;induction motor drive;industrial drives;reduced switching losses;zero-state vectors","","11","","11","","","2000","06 Feb 2000-10 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main contribution of this study is to generalize this method of TEPI, which previously considers data from body-surface electrocardiograms (ECG), to use inputs from electroanatomical voltage mapping (EAVM) on heart surfaces. Feasibility of this new application of TEPI is positively verified on two swine hearts. Furthermore, we involve multiple reference data in forms of in-vivo EAVM and ex-vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the post-infarct scar, allowing a detailed comparison of the three different modalities (EAVM, MRI & TEPI) for imaging/mapping post-infarct substrates. On the two swine models shared by STACOM 2011 EP simulation challenge, we are able to preliminarily demonstrate that, compared to the low-voltage surface scar area detected by EAVM, the 3D scar volume detected by TEPI is more consistent with scar volume delineated in MR images.","0276-6574;02766574","978-1-4673-2076-4;9781467320764","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6420502","","Computational modeling;Heart;Magnetic resonance imaging;Mathematical model;Myocardium;Substrates","bioelectric potentials;biomedical MRI;biomedical measurement;cardiology;spatiotemporal phenomena","3D scar volume detection;MRI;STACOM 2011 EP simulation;TEPI;dynamic electrophysiological models;electroanatomical voltage mapping;ex-vivo magnetic resonance imaging;ill-posed problem;in-vivo EAVM;low-voltage surface scar;post-infarct scar;post-infarct substrates;probabilistic integration;spatiotemporal phenomena;surface measurements;swine heart surface;transmural electrophysiological imaging;ventricular action potentials","","0","","13","","","9-12 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is possible to reduce the simulation time without compromising accuracy by exploiting the fact that the behavior of such a circuit in a given high-frequency clock cycle is similar, but not identical, to its behavior in the preceding and following cycles. In particular, the envelope of the high-frequency clock can be followed by accurately computing the circuit behavior over occasional cycles. The authors describe the implementation of an envelope-following method that is particularly efficient for switching power and filter circuits, and they present results demonstrating the method's effectiveness.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-0869-2;0818608692","","10.1109/ICCAD.1988.122546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=122546","","Circuit simulation;Clocks;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Frequency;Power filters;Switched capacitor circuits;Switches;Switching circuits;Switching converters","circuit analysis computing;clocks;digital simulation;power convertors;power integrated circuits;switched filters;switching networks;transients","accuracy;envelope-following method;filter circuits;high-frequency clock cycle;simulation time;switched capacitor filters;switching power converters;transient simulation","","30","2","11","","","7-10 Nov. 1988","07 Nov 1988-10 Nov 1988","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing high quality video over wireless networks towards heterogeneous receivers is a challenging task due to erratic and time-varying nature of a wireless channel. Compressed video bit-streams, such as Scalable Video Coding (SVC), are very vulnerable to channel disturbances when transmitted over error-prone wireless channels. Transmission errors not only corrupt the current frame, but also propagate to next frames along motions prediction path. In this paper we propose a novel scheme for transmission of SVC-based streams over Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) with Unequal Error Protection (UEP) based on Appropriate Path Selection (APS) and Network Coding (NC). The scheme tries to select appropriate paths based on Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) for different SVC layers. It chooses the best path for most important layer, base layer, and less stable paths for enhancement layers. Some nearby nodes along the transmission path are selected for recoding their received packets and store them in buffers for some period of time. The nearby nodes coded packets can be transmit to receivers for recovering the lost packets.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5962784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962784","","Network coding;Peer to peer computing;Receivers;Static VAr compensators;Streaming media;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless networks","diversity reception;network coding;video coding;video streaming;wireless mesh networks","appropriate path selection;enhancement layers;grey relational analysis;layered video transmission;network coding;scalable video coding;unequal error protection;video bit-stream compression;wireless channel;wireless mesh network;wireless path diversity","","2","","16","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, some methods reported in literatures treated the action video sequences as the tensors, and calculated the similarity between two video sequences using CCA. Each of these tensors was unfolded into several matrices or vectors in the previous works. And estimated the similarity between two tensors via accumulating the canonical correlations on all of the pairs of the unfolded matrices or vectors. In this paper, we treat each of the unfolded matrices in a tensor as an individual, instead of accumulating the canonical correlations in a whole tensor, such that we can effectively use the characteristic of each unfolded matrix. We also propose an information fusion method to combine the similarities of each of the unfolded matrices between two tensors. Furthermore, we add the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features to complement the tensor generated by the pure video sequence. Our method is validated on the UCF sports database, and the experimental result shows that the proposed method can compete with the state-of-the-art methods.","","","","10.1109/MVA.2015.7153210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153210","","Computer vision;Correlation;Databases;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Tensile stress;Video sequences","feature extraction;image fusion;image sequences;matrix algebra;object recognition;statistical analysis;tensors;video signal processing","CCA;UCF sports database;action recognition;action video sequences;canonical correlation analysis;dual tensors;factored matrices;histogram-of-oriented gradients features;information fusion method;unfolded matrices;unfolded vectors","","0","","19","","","18-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we study the problem of the optimality of the partial decoding process: we say that a partial decoding algorithm is optimal if, given a rateless code, it is able to maximize the intermediate performance of the code, i.e. it is able to retreive the maximum number of input symbols when a certain number n of coded symbols have been received, for every n.

In this study we constructed a prototype IVUS system that could operate in both fundamental frequency and second harmonic imaging modes. This system uses a conventional, continuously rotating, single-element IVUS catheter and was operated in fundamental 20 MHz, fundamental 40 MHz, and harmonic 40 MHz modes (transmit 20 MHz, receive 40 MHz). Hydrophone beam characterization measurements demonstrated the build-up of a second harmonic signal as a function of increasing pressure. Imaging experiments were conducted in both a tissue-mimicking phantom and in an atherosclerotic animal model in vivo.

By using both phase and magnitude information, negative-sequence current could be used to detect minor turn-to-turn faults involving 3% of the transformer's windings or more. Turn-to-turn faults may still occur even if no current is flowing on one side of the transformer, such as during energization. With no current flowing in the secondary windings of the transformer, negative-sequence current-based algorithms become insensitive. This paper introduces a relay prototype, using both negative-sequence current and negative-sequence voltage, which retains its sensitivity during energization. The relay's performance for several commonly encountered system scenarios, such as overexcitation, current-transformer saturation, nonzero fault resistance, transformer energization, and external faults were also examined. The experimental results presented in this paper indicate that the algorithm proposed in this paper is faster and more sensitive than restrained current differential protection and is capable of detecting turn-to-turn faults occurring during transformer energization.","0885-8977;08858977","","","10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2483524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296698","Digital protection;transformer protection","Circuit faults;Current transformers;Phase transformers;Power transformer insulation;Surges;Windings","fault diagnosis;power transformer protection;relay protection","current transformer saturation;digital relay;external faults;negative sequence current;negative sequence turn-to-turn fault detection;negative sequence voltage;nonzero fault resistance;power transformer;transformer energization;transformer overexcitation","","","","21","","2015-10-12","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The landing is aided by the comparison of the reference images previously captured and stored in the UAV memory. Each image is captured at specific parameters like time interval, angle of motion, speed, distance, altitude, image deflection angle, position etc. These parameters are of vital importance for the image comparison at real time operation capture. The images are captured at the landing phase, where the UAV glides through a specific angle for landing. At the landing phase the projection of the camera with respect to the runway must be aligned to the standard initial position, since the aircraft glides at a specific angle thereby effecting an angular change with respect to ground. This can be achieved by applying a feedback control loop using the signal response from the gyro. The UAV captures frames during its flight and compares them with the reference frames. By comparison of frames the corresponding feedback output is generated and applied to the UAV for it to align stable at the desired flight path and angle. The feedback output generation can be programmed by tools like SIFT or RANSAC algorithm using edge detection and homography techniques. Optical flow is computed either by Lukas-Kanade or Horn-Schunck method.","1095-323X;1095323X","978-1-4244-7350-2;9781424473502","","10.1109/AERO.2011.5747518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5747518","Landing;UAV;Vision Landing","Adaptive optics;Cameras;Computer vision;Equations;Image motion analysis;Mathematical model;Optical imaging","aircraft landing guidance;edge detection;feedback;image matching;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles;robot vision","RANSAC algorithm;SIFT algorithm;aircraft guidance;automated landing system;edge detection;feedback control loop;homography technique;image comparison;image reference technique;unmanned aerial vehicle;vision based landing","","0","","5","","","5-12 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These modifications are also needed to better incorporate uncertainty in the decision support tools available to operators. In all time frames, the goal is to make effective use of flexible resources by considering appropriate tradeoffs between their costs and the capabilities they provide.

Generally, the performance of a model has always been the primary focus in most data mining jobs. Where there are serious risks posed by the decisions made by a model, it is not feasible to view comprehensibility aspects of a model as secondary to performance. While model comprehensibility is a topic that has aroused a lot of interest with two conference workshops (AI-UCAI'95 & AAAI 2005) placing it as its keynote issue and many papers written about it, there are no empirical methods of measuring it or even one consistent way to define it. It is generally accepted that smaller models are more comprehensible than larger ones. This forms the basis of most researches conducted in this area. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of using multiobjective optimization in the Pareto sense to meet comprehensibility demands of models. Some of the objective functions used in this paper are novel while others have been used in other researches before. The results obtained show that incorporating aspects of comprehensibility in the induction process models does not necessarily retard the performance of models and could actually improve the performance versus complexity trade-off of evolutionary polynomial-fuzzy structures","","0-7803-9718-5;0780397185","0-7803-9719-3;0780397193","10.1109/ISEFS.2006.251143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016707","","Data mining;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy systems;Genetic programming;Humans;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Pareto optimization;Polynomials;Predictive models","Pareto optimisation;data mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;medicine;pattern classification;polynomials","Pareto optimization;comprehensibility;data mining;evolutionary polynomial-fuzzy classification models;induction process models;medical predictive modeling;multiobjective optimization","","0","","28","","","7-9 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle this problem, inlet air with moderate temperature and server consolidation are widely adopted. However, the benefit of these two methods is limited due to conventional air cooling system ineffectiveness caused by recirculation and low heat capacity. To address this problem, hybrid air and liquid cooling, as a practical and inexpensive approach, has been introduced. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the impact of server consolidation and temperature of cooling water on the total electricity and server maintenance costs in hybrid cooling data centers. To minimize the total costs, we proposed to maintain sweet temperature and available sleeping time threshold (ASTT) by which a joint cost optimization can be satisfied. By using real-world traces, the potential savings of sweet temperature and ASTT are estimated to be average 23% of the total cost, while 96% requests are satisfied compared to a strategy which only reduces electricity cost. The co-optimization is extended to increase the benefit of the renewable energy, and its profit grows as more wind power is supplied.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2462714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7210179","Cost optimization;data center;hybrid cooling;renewable energy","Cooling;Hardware;Maintenance engineering;Optimization;Program processors;Servers;Wind speed","","","","0","","","","2015-08-19","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To be able effectively control the power flow so that losses and voltage stability are at optimum level, UPFC parameters need to be tuned by using optimization algorithm. This paper describes how Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique can be used to tune the parameters of FACTS device in order to improve power system performance. ACO is a new cooperative agent's approach, which is inspired by the observation of the behaviours of real ant colonies on the topics of ant trial formation and foraging method.

Therefore, pervasive applications need a middleware that can detect and act upon any context changes created by the result of any interactions between users, applications, and surrounding computing environment for applications without users, interventions. To achieve this goal, one of the problems is how to continuously monitor/capture and interpret the environment related information efficiently to assure high context awareness by the middleware. Many attentions have been paid to the research of the context-aware pervasive applications. Existing context information that supports service (component) adaptations is provided by the context-aware infrastructure, which gathers, pre-processes and provisions context information from a variety of context information sources. However, the context-aware applications is usually prone to failures and disconnections that negatively impact on the ability of them to adapt (and therefore dramatically impact on their usability). So we should take the Quality of Context (QoC) into account. And the procession of gathering, pre-processing and providing context information must be autonomic to the end users. Therefore, we propose an autonomic quality management middleware to support QoC management based context provision. By this middleware, we can configure different strategies to refinery raw context, discard duplicate and inconsistent context adaptively so as to protect and provide QoS-enriched context information of users to context-aware applications and services.","","978-1-4673-0241-8;9781467302418","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295288","Agent;Context-aware;Pervasive;QoC;middleware","Cognition;Computers;Context;Context-aware services;Middleware;Sensors","middleware;mobile computing;quality of service","QoS-enriched context information;autonomic context processing;autonomic quality management middleware;context awareness;context-aware pervasive applications;distributed mobile computing;environment related information;information technology;refinery raw context","","1","","13","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SOPC technology, developed by Altera Corporation, consists of a FPGA (field programmable gate array) and a Nios embedded processor. In this proposed servo control IC, there are two modules. One module performs the functions of the sequential control, the motion trajectory control and five-axis position control. The other module performs the functions of the five sets of PWM (pulse width modulation) generation and QEP (quadrature encoder pulse) capture. The former is implemented by software using Nios embedded processor due to the need of complicated control algorithm and low sampling frequency control (motion trajectory control & position control: less than 1 kHz). The latter is implemented by hardware using PLD (programmable logic device) in FPGA due to the need of high sampling frequency control (PWM circuit: 18 kHz, peripheral circuits: 4~8 MHz) but simple computation. As the result, the use of the SOPC technology can make the controller of the vertical articulated robot arm more compact, high performance and cost down.","","0-7803-8998-0;0780389980","","10.1109/ICMECH.2005.1529314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1529314","","Circuits;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency control;Motion control;Position control;Pulse width modulation;Robots;Sampling methods;Servosystems;Space vector pulse width modulation","control engineering computing;control system synthesis;field programmable gate arrays;manipulators;motion control;position control;programmable logic devices;servomechanisms;system-on-chip","FPGA;Nios embedded processor;SOPC technology;five-axis position control;motion trajectory control;programmable logic device;pulse width modulation generation;quadrature encoder pulse;sequential control;servo control IC;system-on-a-programmable-chip technology;vertical articulated robot arm","","9","","8","","","10-12 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies a total yard operation inflow and outflow of containers and cargos where different stakeholders depend on the operation of off-dock terminal. The primary challenge is to efficiently operate the operations and acquire the real-time data to minimize the operation lag due to information passing delay. In particular, to automate the every process, an online activity base strategy is used. This strategy groups jointly co-operate with OLAP and data mining process to reduce the manual work. An approach has been introduced to automate the all operational activity of off-dock as well as container terminal in real time basis. The methodology is approaching a cost-effective and authenticated communication through different stake holders of container terminal i.e. main line operator (MLO), freight forwarder, C&F agents, shipper, consignee etc. The model is solved using message passing strategy. Due to required interaction and multiple hub access issues a standard structure is introduced with details specification. The communication architecture has implemented through the authenticated portable database tool, extended markup language (XML). To establish the easy communication through the end point, email client is introduced. For ensuring the information security MD5 encryption method has also used. This approach helps to atomize the full industry segment to work in one umbrella. The standard message structure ensures data validity among the stakeholders. This approach also can be used to communicate within different application where this approach would be work as a communication agent.","","978-1-4244-1550-2;9781424415502","978-1-4244-1551-9;9781424415519","10.1109/ICCITECHN.2007.4579436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579436","Automation;Communication Architecture;Container Terminal;Data mining;OLAP;Off-Dock","Containers;Cryptography;Data mining;Databases;Delay;Information security;Markup languages;Message passing;Prototypes;XML","XML;containerisation;cryptography;data mining;freight handling;message authentication;message passing","EBILCY prototype;Extended Markup Language;MD5 encryption method;OLAP;XML;authenticated communication;authenticated portable database tool;automated container yard management;cargo handling;data mining;inter organization communication architecture model;message passing strategy;off-dock terminal operation;real time activity base online transmission","","0","","11","","","27-29 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The vocal tract frequency response is reconstructed from the bispectrum on a set of frequency points that are multiples of the pitch. An AR model is next fitted on this transfer function.

Specifically, molecular beacons, based on single strands of DNA, are used as hybridization probes that can potentially detect single nucleotide polymorphisms. This technique combines the use of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) that fluoresce and the gold nanoparticles as a quencher moiety. This QD-oligonucleotide complex can recognize and pair with its complementary DNA strand. This high affinity of DNA oligonucleotides for its complementary strand has been used to form a simple semiconductor probe for ultra sensitive DNA detection. MicroRaman (Â¿Raman) signatures of DNA self-assembled on a variety of substrates will be discussed in terms of the THz spectra of DNA.

The aid permits users to modify the initially assessed likelihood ratios and resulting posterior odds for the hypotheses under consideration until they feel comfortable with the inferred implications of the data. The aid was applied to the area of military tactical intelligence analysis and evaluated experimentally by experienced analysts on a training task representative of that decisionmaking environment. Experienced and inexperienced (but trained) analysts working with the aid were 1) better able to discriminate between the most and least likely hypotheses and 2) assigned final likelihoods to the hypotheses that were more similar to normative likelihoods derived from Bayes' theorem than unaided analysts. In addition, analyses of individual analysts revealed large differences in decisionmaking strategies. These differences demonstrate that users can approach the inference problem using their own decisionmaking style, thereby ensuring user control over all stages of the decisionmaking process.","0018-9472;00189472","","","10.1109/TSMC.1982.4308907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4308907","","Bayesian methods;Decision theory;Humans;Information processing;Large-scale systems;Usability;User interfaces","","","","5","","27","","","Nov. 1982","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As all piconets operate in the same frequency band, the presence of multiple piconets in the vicinity may create interference on signal reception. This paper employs a signal capture model to study the piconet MAC performance, taking inter-piconet interference into consideration. This model leads to several important mathematical relationships for Bluetooth networks, including successful packet transmission probability. Furthermore, our model and anticipated throughput are validated using extensive simulation. These results indicate that Bluetooth throughput is affected by multiple piconet interference.

LSS has the finite sample convergence property, i.e., in the absence of noise, the channel is estimated perfectly with only a finite number of data samples. Referred to as the adaptive least squares smoothing (A-LSS) algorithm, the adaptive implementation has a high convergence rate and low computation cost with no matrix operations. A-LSS is order recursive and is implemented in part using a lattice filter.

Mathematically, a repetitive controller is equivalent to a parallel combination of resonant controllers with high gain at the fundamental frequency and its harmonics, and accordingly good disturbance rejection can be achieved at these frequencies. To ensure stability, a low-pass filter needs to be incorporated within the repetitive controller to attenuate the high frequency resonant peaks of the controller gain (above the system's cross-over frequency), without significantly affecting the low frequency resonant peaks corresponding to significant grid harmonics that need to be rejected. The paper therefore argues that it is desirable that the system and the inverter's output filter should have a high bandwidth - higher than the most significant grid harmonics - which may be counter intuitive. The high bandwidth requirement dictates a high PWM switching frequency, which becomes challenging in high power systems as the maximum achievable switching frequency of power electronic devices reduces as their power rating increases. This limitation can be overcome in low voltage systems by using an interleaved inverter topology in which the power is shared between several 2-level half-bridge inverter legs connected in parallel. In addition to using low power devices capable of high switching frequency, the value of the LC output filter capacitance can be relatively very small thanks to the ripple cancellation feature of the interleaved inverter. Both of these features mean that the bandwidth of an interleaved inverter can be much higher than that achievable using a classical 2-level inverter with an LCL output filter. The paper discusses the design and practical implementation of a repetitive controller for an interleaved inverter with 6 half-bridge legs per phase. Simulation and experimental results are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co- troller in improving the THD of the output current of the inverter.","2329-5759;23295759","978-1-4673-2021-4;9781467320214","978-1-4673-2022-1;9781467320221","10.1109/PEDG.2012.6254057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6254057","grid-connected inverters;interleaved inverters;repetitive control","Bandwidth;Harmonic analysis;Inverters;Low pass filters;Power harmonic filters;Pulse width modulation;Resonant frequency","PWM invertors;bridge circuits;electric current control;harmonic distortion;low-pass filters;power filters;resonant power convertors","2-level half-bridge inverter legs;LCL output filter;PWM switching frequency;controller gain;disturbance rejection;grid harmonics;interleaved grid connected inverter;interleaved inverter topology;low-pass filter;power electronic devices;power rating;repetitive current control;resonant controllers;ripple cancellation feature;total harmonic distortion","","5","","17","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To protect internal resources, organizations usually purchased and installed an Internet firewall. We believe that the currently deployed wireless access points present a larger security problem than the early Internet connections. A large number of organizations, based on vendor literature, believe that the security provided by their deployed wireless access points is sufficient to prevent unauthorized access and use. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. While the current access points provide several security mechanisms, our work combined with the work of others show that all of these mechanisms are completely ineffective. As a result, organizations with deployed wireless networks are vulnerable to unauthorized use of, and access to, their internal infrastructure. We present a novel solution that requires no changes or additions to any deployed wireless equipment, and is easily deployed and transparent to end users.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2002.1160080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1160080","","Access control;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Internet;Local area networks;Protection;Virtual private networks;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","IEEE standards;Internet;access protocols;authorisation;firmware;message authentication;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards","80211 wireless network;IEEE 802.11 wireless standard;Internet firewall;MAC address control lists;PCMCIA card;closed network scheme;firmware;key management;network configuration modes;security mechanisms;shared key authentication;unauthorized access;wireless access points security;wireless equipment","","54","4","1","","","Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

FMCAD '08","20081125","2008","","","1","8","A message flow is a sequence of messages sent among processors during the execution of a protocol, usually illustrated with something like a message sequence chart. Protocol designers use message flows to describe and reason about their protocols. We show how to derive high-quality invariants from message flows and use these invariants to accelerate a state-of-the-art method for parameterized protocol verification called the CMP method. The CMP method works by iteratively strengthening and abstracting a protocol. The labor-intensive portion of the method is finding the protocol invariants needed for each iteration. We provide a new analysis of the CMP method proving it works with any sound abstraction procedure. This facilitates the use of a new abstraction procedure tailored to our protocol invariants in the CMP method. Our experience is that message-flow derived invariants get to the heart of protocol correctness in the sense that only couple of additional invariants are needed for the CMP method to converge.","","978-1-4244-2735-2;9781424427352","978-1-4244-2736-9;9781424427369","10.1109/FMCAD.2008.ECP.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689173","","Acceleration;Protocols","formal verification;message passing","CMP method;message flow;message sequence chart;parameterized protocol verification;protocol invariant;sound abstraction","","12","","25","","","17-20 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With increasing impregnation ratio and activation time, the adsorption capacity of sorbent made from calcium lignosulfonate on methylene blue and iodine had very degrees of increase. As activation temperature increased, its methylene blue adsorption value was improved significantly, but its iodine adsorption capacity went down. While impregnation ratio, activation temperature and activation time were increased, there was a certain extent of improvement on iodine adsorption capacity of sorbent, which was obtained from magnesium lignosulfonate.

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with a deposition model is developed to assess the performance degradation of wind turbines operating in the dusty Saharan regions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The full two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the SST k-ω turbulence model were used to investigate the incompressible viscous flow past a two-dimensional airfoil section (NACA 63-215) of a wind turbine blade under clean and fouled surface conditions. The developed model is used to estimate the role roughness plays in promoting premature transition to turbulence and in fact flow separation has been identified by the numerical results. The effect of roughness height and roughness area on both the lift and drag coefficients have been inspected. For the purpose of validation, the model predictions are compared with the experimental data of Khalfallaha [1] and the numerical results of Nianxin Ren [3] and are found consistent with both.","","","","10.1109/ICRERA.2013.6749867","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6749867","effect of dust;performance degradation;wind turbine","Atmospheric modeling;Blades;Mathematical model;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface treatment;Wind turbines","Navier-Stokes equations;aerodynamics;blades;computational fluid dynamics;dust;flow separation;numerical analysis;surface roughness;turbulence;wind turbines","2D Navier-Stokes equations;2D airfoil section;CFD simulation;SST k-w turbulence model;blade aerodynamic characteristics;computational fluid dynamics;deposition model;dust accumulation;dusty Saharan regions;dusty environment;flow separation;incompressible viscous flow;premature transition;surface roughness estimation;wind turbine blade performance degradation analysis","","0","","13","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on a worst-case design philosophy, the design problem is formulated as a minimax optimization problem from the signal energy point of view, and subsequently solved by two interactive genetic algorithms. To ensure robust stability of the closed-loop system, root locations of the Kharitonov polynomials associated with the characteristic polynomial are used to establish a constraint handling mechanism for incorporation into the fitness function to effectively evaluate chromosomes in the current population. To accelerate the derivation process to obtain the optimal controller, alternative approaches based on the two-phase evolutionary scheme are also proposed, in which the worst-case ISE is suitably estimated via information provided by the Kharitonov plants. Thus, the derived controller not only stabilizes the interval plant, but also minimizes the ISE criterion of the closed-loop system. Constraints on higher order plants and controller order commonly encountered by conventional design methods are therefore removed by using the proposed approach.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.826396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298909","","Algorithm design and analysis;Control systems;Design optimization;Error correction;Genetic algorithms;Minimax techniques;Optimal control;Polynomials;Robust stability;Signal design","closed loop systems;genetic algorithms;minimisation;optimal control;power plants;robust control","Kharitonov plants;closed-loop system;constraint handling;evolutionary computation;integral of squared error;interactive genetic algorithm;interval plant;minimax optimization;optimal controller;robust stability;signal energy point","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Computer-Aided Design;Equipment Design;Evolution;Feedback;Models, Genetic;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Systems Theory","6","","30","","","June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the primary mechanical load applied to the structure governs the orientation of these slotted waveguides and so limits electronic beam steering to just one plane. This work extends the SWASS concept by demonstrating a means to achieve electronic phase shifting along the waveguide axis. This is accomplished by incorporating a varactor loaded coaxial composite right / left handed transmission line (CRLH-TL) into the SWASS for approximate matched tuning of the dispersion diagram about the design frequency.","","978-1-4799-1229-2;9781479912292","","10.1109/MetaMaterials.2013.6808969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6808969","","Microwave antennas;Microwave theory and techniques;Optical waveguides;Power transmission lines;Slot antennas;Varactors","beam steering;microwave metamaterials;microwave phase shifters;slot antenna arrays;transmission lines;varactors","CRLH-TL;SWASS concept;aircraft sandwich structures;approximate matched tuning;blade stiffeners;conventional hat-stiffeners;design frequency;dispersion diagram;electronic beam steering;electronic phase shifting;electronically tunable composite right/left handed transmission line;microwave waveguides;outer skin;primary mechanical load;slot machining;slotted waveguide antenna arrays;slotted waveguide antenna stiffened structure;slotted waveguide orientation;varactor loaded coaxial composite right/left handed transmission line;waveguide axis","","0","","9","","","16-21 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Brand extension is widely applied as a corporate strategy in the economic life. Some companies succeed in brand extension, some fail. So it is very important to study the case and theory of brand extension. Brand extension has its own background and reasons. Brand extension is not only the way to use the brand equity but also the way to increase the brand equity. Brand extension has different types including line extension, associated brand, etc. Different type of brand has different brand extension capacity. The brand that belongs to nonobjective type has best extension capacity. The extension capacity of brand that belongs to functional or technical type cannot compare with nonobjective type. In this research we propose a Weighted Feature C-means clustering algorithm (WF-C-means) to group all prior cases in the case base into several clusters.

Split-conductor cables are discussed at considerable length, both as to design and operation. Paired ordinary conductors also are discussed, and their relation to so-called split-conductors pointed out. Special apparatus and devices required in connection with current-balancing schemes are illustrated and discussed. A partial nomenclature is proposed, to assist in clearing the way for intelligent discussion and a uniform understanding of the general subject of current-balance protection for paired conductors. A schedule of installations in the Boston system is given in order that the extent of the work described may be visualized, supplemented by a description of the results obtained in actual operation. No general conclusions are drawn since the paper is of the nature of a report on progress; specific conclusions are drawn, however, in a number of cases where the evidence or experience appears to be reasonably conclusive. A mathematical discussion of a number of reactive end-impedance devices, by Professor C. A.

Positive charge trapping is observed for unstressed devices, and for devices irradiated under both compressive and tensile stress. Reduced trapped charge is measured as the uniaxial stress level increases. These results suggest that the increased stress leads to a reconfiguration of defect microstructure, as compared to the unstressed devices. The reconfiguration consists of changes in bond lengths and angles and a corresponding change in trap energy levels, which can (1) reduce the probability that a defect can capture holes, (2) increase the probability for electron and trapped-hole recombination, and/or (3) increase the mobility of the transporting holes in the oxides of the devices that are irradiated under stress. These results show that increased mechanical stress in high-k dielectrics does not degrade their radiation hardness.

To this end, we apply three methods, Spontaneous Low Frequency Fluctuation (SLFF), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and Seed Correlation Analysis (SCA). The results of advanced statistical image analysis on SLFF maps show hypoactivation in the basal ganglia and hyperactivation in the motor cortex and the cerebellum. We found that the seed correlation value between Left cerebellum and left putamen is the most discriminating parameter between Parkinson patients and healthy group.

This paper presents a simple and accurate analysis using Markov chain modelling to compute IEEE 802.11 DCF performance, in the absence of hidden stations and transmission errors. This mathematical analysis calculates in addition to the throughput efficiency, the average packet delay and the packet drop probability for both the basic access and RTS/CTS medium access schemes. The derived analysis, which takes into account packet retry limits, is validated by comparison with OPNET simulation results. The mathematical model is used to study the effectiveness of the RTS/CTS scheme at high data rates and the performance improvements of transmitting a burst of packets after winning the contention for medium access. Packet bursting considerably increases both throughput and packet delay performance but lowers the short-term fairness on medium access.","","0-7803-8798-8;0780387988","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2004.1417582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1417582","","Access protocols;Analytical models;Delay;Mathematical analysis;Mathematical model;Media Access Protocol;Performance analysis;Probability;Throughput;Wireless LAN","Markov processes;access protocols;mathematical analysis;probability;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function;Markov chain;mathematical model;medium access control mechanism;packet bursting;packet drop probability;wireless local area network","","13","","12","","","29 Nov.-3 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this letter, we demonstrate that reflectance intensity at the resonant frequency is more sensitive than frequency shift to changes in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant associated with the absorbance of the sample. Moreover, we distinguished significant changes in reflectance between a cell monolayer in a medium cultured directly onto the SRR and the SRR with medium alone.

Both acoustic amplitude and phase are recorded, allowing full calibration and determination of phases to within a single arbitrary constant. Results are presented of measurements at frequencies of 800-900 MHz, illustrating a multitude of normal mode behavior in electrically driven thin film acoustic resonators. Coupled with microwave electrical impedance measurements, this imaging mode provides an exceptionally fast method for evaluation of electric-to-acoustic coupling of these devices and their performance. Images of 256 /spl times/ 240 pixels are recorded at 18 fps rates synchronized to obtain both in-phase and quadrature detection of the acoustic motion.

For example, estrogen replacement improves verbal memory in women, and animal studies have shown effects of estrogen on hippocampal synaptogenesis and function. Little is known about sex steroid effects on other aspects of memory, such as frontal lobe-mediated working memory. We examined the relationships between working memory and sex steroid concentrations and whether sex steroid supplementation would modify age-related loss of working memory in older men and women. Before hormone supplementation, working memory, tested with the Subject Ordered Pointing Test (SOP), was worse in older subjects than younger subjects, and there was no evidence of gender differences at either age. Testosterone supplementation improved working memory in older men, but a similar enhancement of working memory was not found in older women supplemented with estrogen. In men, testosterone and estrogen effects were reciprocal—with better working memory related to a higher testosterone to estrogen ratio. These results suggest that sex steroids can modulate working memory in men and can act as modulators of cognition throughout life.","0898-929X;0898929X","","","10.1162/089892900562228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787681","","","","","","0","6","","","","May 2000","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

"Self-Sustainable Communications With RF Energy Harvesting: Ginibre Point Process Modeling and Analysis","X. Lu; I. Flint; D. Niyato; N. Privault; P.

The network devices are replenished by the RF energy harvested from the transmission of ambient RF transmitters, which offers a practical and promising solution to enable self-sustainable communications. This paper adopts a stochastic geometry framework based on the Ginibre model to analyze the performance of self-sustainable communications over cellular networks with general fading channels. Specifically, we consider the point-to-point downlink transmission between an access point and a battery-free device in the cellular networks, where the ambient RF transmitters are randomly distributed following a repulsive point process, called Ginibre α-determinantal point process (DPP). Two practical RF energy harvesting receiver architectures, namely time-switching and power-splitting, are investigated. We perform an analytical study on the RF-powered device and derive the expectation of the RF energy harvesting rate, the energy outage probability and the transmission outage probability over Nakagami-m fading channels. These are expressed in terms of so-called Fredholm determinants, which we compute efficiently with modern techniques from numerical analysis. Our analytical results are corroborated by the numerical simulations, and the efficiency of our approximations is demonstrated. In practice, the accurate simulation of any of the Fredholm determinant appearing in the manuscript is a matter of seconds. An interesting finding is that a smaller value of α (corresponding to larger repulsion) yields a better transmission outage performance when the density of the ambient RF transmitters is small.

First, the two-instantaneous-value-product algorithm is developed, and different variation trends of the fundamental current amplitude for inrush current and internal fault current are analyzed. Then, according to the descending features of the fundamental current amplitude, the inrush current and internal fault current can be distinguished from each other. A total of 216 experimental measurements have been tested on an YNd11 connected transformer. Dynamic testing results indicate that this method is able to clear internal faults, even light ones, within a cycle and is not affected by the current transformer saturation. Moreover, compared with the second harmonic restraint principle and the waveform comparison principle, the proposed algorithm has better performance. The computational simplicity of the proposed scheme enables its implementation in real-time applications with low-cost microprocessors.","0840-8688;08408688","","","10.1109/CJECE.2013.6544469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544469","fundamental current amplitude;inrush current;internal fault;transformer protection;two-instantaneous-value-product algorithm","Algorithm design and theory;Circuit faults;Harmonic analysis;Magnetic cores;Power transformers;Saturation magnetization;Surge protection","feature extraction;microprocessor chips;power transformer protection","dynamic testing;feature extraction;inrush current;internal fault current;low-cost microprocessors;transformer;two-instantaneous-value-product algorithm","","1","","","","","Winter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The terminal categories can be alternately letters or phone units, yielding a reversible letter-to-sound/sound-to-letter system. In conjunction with a segment network and acoustic phone models, the system can produce phonemic-to-phonetic alignments for speech waveforms. For speech recognition, ANGIE uses a one-pass bottom-up best-first search strategy. Evaluated in the ATIS domain, ANGIE achieved a phone error rate of 36%, as compared with 40% achieved with a baseline phone-bigram based recognizer under similar conditions.

The measurements were designed to be as similar as possible to facilitate a straight-forward comparison of the different sources. Measurements were conducted with a high-duty factor electron accelerator using bremsstrahlung photons, with a pulsed linear accelerator using bremsstrahlung photons, and with a narrow bandwidth photon source using Compton backscattered photons.

Reconstruction using DDC is efficient in recovering the edge, texture and smoothness regions. And the masking of the DCT coefficient can remove unnecessary DCT coefficients.

The UV source emitted mixed spectrum of light with 254 nm and 185 nm wavelength. The comparative trial was performed to investigate the effects of additional UV exposure and to optimize the exposure time. Infrared inspection, tensile strength test and FSEM scan were performed to verify the qualification with detailed results and discussion. It is found that bond rate of wafers treated with 5 minutes UV exposure increased after annealing at 350degC while several voids would appear for exposure time of 10 minutes. Besides, the relationship of annealing temperature and bond rate was also studied. It is found that as annealing temperature raised, the formed gases would be easy to accumulate in the existing cavities or form new voids in the interface to decrease the bond rate. The relatively higher tensile strength up to 15.1 MPa was obtained when exposure to UV for 5 minutes. Finally, FSEM images were given with explanation of different thicknesses of interface layers due to UV exposure. It is concluded that as an additional cleaning and modification treatment, appropriate UV exposure is demonstrated as an effective technique to enhanced bond quality. High bond rate, tensile strength as well as thinner interface layer can be achieved by exposure for 5 minutes. Prolonging the exposure time may decrease the bond-ability as well as the bond quality.","1944-9399;19449399","978-1-4244-0607-4;9781424406074","978-1-4244-0608-1;9781424406081","10.1109/NANO.2007.4601296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601296","UV exposure;bond quality;low temperature wafer direct bonding;surface cleaning and modification","Annealing;Chemical processes;Inspection;Performance evaluation;Qualifications;Silicon;Temperature;Testing;Ultraviolet sources;Wafer bonding","annealing;elemental semiconductors;field emission electron microscopy;infrared spectra;scanning electron microscopy;silicon;surface cleaning;tensile strength;tensile testing;ultraviolet radiation effects;voids (solid);wafer bonding","FSEM;Si;annealing;hydrophilic silicon wafer;infrared inspection;interface layers;interface quality test;light spectrum;low temperature wafer direct bonding;surface cleaning;temperature 350 degC;tensile strength test;time 5 min;ultraviolet exposure;voids;wavelength 185 nm;wavelength 254 nm;wet chemical activation","","0","","8","","","2-5 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Metal layers were confined to the sensing electrodes and electrical routings; the metal-oxide composite in the CMOS-MEMS accelerometer was distributed in limited regions. This design has two major advantages: 1) the thermal deformation of suspended MEMS structures resulting from a mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the metal and the oxide in the metal-oxide films is suppressed; and 2) the parasitic capacitance of the sensing electrode routing underneath the proof mass is reduced. Thus, the accelerometer has higher sensitivity and reduced thermal drift. The curvature of the mechanical structures are improved in the temperature span and the noise floor is lowered. In the full temperature span (30 °C-90 °C), change in the radius of curvature per unit change in the temperature was 0.08%/°C for the in-plane accelerometer and 0.37%/°C for the out-of-plane accelerometer. Compared with the typical metal-oxide design, the proposed pure oxide design yielded a >20-fold improvement in radius of curvature change per unit temperature change for the in-plane accelerometer and a fivefold improvement for the out-of-plane accelerometer. Moreover, the noise floor was reduced to 0.40 (x-axis), 0.21 (y-axis), and 0.94 mG Hz<sup>-1/2</sup> (z-axis), respectively, a 2.2-7.6-fold improvement compared with the metal-oxide design.","1057-7157;10577157","","","10.1109/JMEMS.2015.2452270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167668","Complementary metal oxide semiconductor-microelectromechanical system CMOS-MEMS;Complementary metal oxide semiconductor???microelectromechanical system CMOS???MEMS;coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch;parasitic capacitance;parasitic capacitance.;pure oxide structure;tri-axis accelerometers","Accelerometers;Deformable models;Electrodes;Metals;Micromechanical devices;Parasitic capacitance;Sensors","CMOS integrated circuits;accelerometers;composite materials;electrodes;integrated circuit design;metallisation;microsensors;monolithic integrated circuits;network routing","complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor;electrical routings;mechanical structures;metal layers;metal-oxide composite;metal-oxide design;metal-oxide films;microelectromechanical system;monolithic CMOS-MEMS pure oxide triaxis accelerometers;noise floor;parasitic capacitance;proof mass;pure oxide design;sensing electrode routing;sensing electrodes;stacked pure oxide layers;suspended MEMS structures;temperature 30 degC to 90 degC;temperature stabilization;thermal deformation;thermal drift;thermal expansion","","1","","28","","2015-07-27","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In such a scenario, reducing the number of features in order to allow a symbolic learner to build a correct conceptual model of underlying phenomena is a fundamental task. Only few feature selection approaches deal with finding relevant features in multivariate time series, which is just what the robot receives through its sensors. In this paper, we present results of applicability of a range of feature selection and time series analysis approaches on a novel real world scenario for autonomous robotic discovery.

A framework of tactile telepresence systems, which is suitable in remote environments, has been proposed in the present paper. In the framework, a tactile display locally generates the tactile stimulus in synchronization with the touch motion of the operator in order to cancel communication delay. The tactile stimulus is generated by combining the motion and tactile factors, which are sensed by a tactile sensor. The factors are characteristic parameters of objects and effect on tactile sensations. In the present paper, physical parameters of the objects are selected as the factors because the tactile stimuli can be computed using physical models involving the motions and the parameters.

The inhomogeneities of the torso are modeled as eccentric spherical volumes with both the curvature and the rotation features of cardiac fibers incorporated in the myocardial region. The numerical computation of the finite element bidomain myocardial model is validated by a semianalytic solution. The simulations show that rotation of fiber orientation through the depth of the myocardial wall changes the pattern of polarization and decreases the amount of cardiac tissue polarized compared to the idealized analytic model with no fiber rotation incorporated. The TMP induced by transthoracic and transvenous defibrillation fields are calculated and visualized. The TMP is quantified by a continuous measure of the percentage of myocardial mass above a potential gradient threshold. Using this measure, the root mean square differences in TMP distribution produced by reversing the electrode polarity for anterior-posterior and transvenous electrode configurations are 13.6 and 28.6%, respectively. These results support the claim that a bidomain model of the heart predicts a change of defibrillation threshold with reversed electrode polarity.","0018-9294;00189294","","","10.1109/10.736750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=736750","","Analytical models;Biomembranes;Computational modeling;Defibrillation;Electrodes;Finite element methods;Heart;Myocardium;Optical fiber polarization;Torso","biological effects of fields;biomembranes;cardiology;finite element analysis;physiological models","bidomain model;bidomain myocardium;cardiac electrophysiology;defibrillation fields;defibrillation threshold;electrode polarity reversal;fiber orientation rotation;idealized 3-D finite element bidomain/monodomain torso model;induced membrane polarization;myocardial mass percentage;polarised cardiac tissue;torso inhomogeneities;transmembrane potential;transvenous defibrillation fields","Computer Simulation;Electric Countershock;Electrophysiology;Finite Element Analysis;Heart;Humans;Mathematics;Membrane Potentials;Models, Cardiovascular;Neural Conduction","4","","42","","","Jan. 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a result such errors, the system can not gain its maximum throughput. In this paper, we investigate the performance of opportunistic communications system considering imperfect SNR reports. We show that in order to maximize the throughput, the transmitter needs to estimate the channel state information.

Fabrication of high-frequency phased array transducers is challenging due to the inter-element pitch constraint (~0.5 λ) to avoid large grating lobe artifacts. Phase coherence imaging (PCI) has been introduced as a method for suppressing grating lobes in large-pitch arrays, however, it is not as effective when the grating lobe echoes have large overlap in the time-domain. In previous work we suggested a technique called split-aperture transmit beamforming to increase the effectiveness of PCI in grating lobe suppression of these arrays and used computer simulation to evaluate its effectiveness. In the present work we report on the experimental verification of the technique using a commercially available high-frequency ultrasound linear array system (Vevo 2100, Visualsonics). We demonstrate that by using only two split-aperture transmit beamforming events along with PCI we can effectively suppress the grating lobes resulting from a 50 MHz, 64-element, 1.26 λ pitch phased array to less than 60 db for a wire-phantom placed at 25 degrees from the center of transducer. We further show that this grating lobe suppression greatly improves the contrast in tissue phantom. Finally, we show that the measured beamformed radiation patterns are consistent with simulations.","1051-0117;10510117","978-1-4577-1253-1;9781457712531","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2011.0280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6293607","Grating lobe;High-frequency ultrasound;K split-aperture transmit beamforming;Large-pitch phased array;Phase coherence imaging","Antenna radiation patterns;Apertures;Array signal processing;Gratings;Imaging;Phased arrays;Transducers","array signal processing;biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;computerised instrumentation;medical image processing;time-domain analysis;ultrasonic transducer arrays","PCI;beamformed radiation patterns;computer simulation;frequency 50 MHz;grating lobe echoes;grating lobe suppression;high-frequency phased array transducer fabrication;high-frequency ultrasound linear array system;interelement pitch constraint;large pitch phased arrays;phase coherence imaging;phased array ultrasound transducers;split-aperture transmit beamforming technique;time-domain;tissue phantom","","2","","14","","","18-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle the problem of premature convergence, we present a new hybrid PSO that incorporates a differential evolution mutation operation with a Gaussian based PSO. Furthermore, by exploiting the specific structure of multiple object interactions, we introduce a cooperative strategy into the proposed PSO for more efficient searching and for conquering the curse of dimensionality.

In order to overcome such difficulty, a band-widening technique of the ceramic resonator loaded band-pass filter has been proposed. The EHnmÂ¿ modes were regarded as spurious modes so far, but it is clear that the coupling factors are larger than those of the Te0nÂ¿ modes from the results of experimental considerations in this paper. By using the : EH11Â¿ mode ceramic resonators, 5-pole, 1dB chebyshev ripple NRD guide band-pass filter has been fabricated for the applications to broad-band millimeter-wave communication systems at 60GHz.

However, much less is known about the specific role of self-generated movement and of behavioral interactions with an environment in the development of complex neuronal properties. To address this question, we designed Darwin V, which consists of a simulated neuronal model embedded in a real world device capable of autonomous behavior. The model has four major components: a visual system incorporating several key properties of mammalian visual cortex, a taste system based on conductance, sets of motor neurons capable of triggering behavior, and a diffuse ascending (value) system. As Darwin V encounters stimulus objects in its environment, synaptic modifications within its visual maps produce pattern-selective and translation invariant neuronal responses. Due to value-dependent synaptic modifications in sensorimotor connections, visual neurons become linked to motor neurons triggering appropriate behaviors. Closer analysis reveals that the acquisition of translation invariance depends critically upon continuous self-generated movements of Darwin V. In addition, the allocation of map areas selective for particular stimulus classes depends upon frequency and historical sequence of stimulus encounters. In summary, the analysis of Darwin V provides several examples for the role of environment and behavior in the development of complex neuronal responses.","","9780262291385","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6278728.pdf&bkn=6267521&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","1998","","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

In this paper, we introduce a new framework called active content fingerprinting, which takes the best from two worlds of content fingerprinting and digital watermarking, in order to overcome some of the fundamental restrictions of these techniques in terms of performance and complexity. The proposed framework extends the encoding process of conventional content fingerprinting in a way similar to digital watermarking, thus allowing the extraction of fingerprints from the modified cover data. We consider several encoding strategies, examine the performance of the proposed schemes in terms of bit error rate, the probabilities of correct identification and false acceptance and compare it with those of conventional fingerprinting and digital watermarking.

Efficiency optimization in an OPO involves reducing the loss due to these effects; however, spatial distribution of amplitude across the beam limits the optimized efficiency. We show that by using a spatially uniform intensity profile for the input pump beam, one can achieve much higher optimized efficiency because of optimum conversion across the whole cross-section of the beam.

Multiple coincidences, those for which more than two gamma-rays are detected within the coincidence time window, are usually discarded. Those events can be registered and used to increase the sensitivity of the scanner and to differentiate positron-gamma emitters from pure positron emitters, enabling multiplexed PET. To assess the effect of triple coincidences in PET scanners, an accurate and reliable simulation toolkit is compulsory. In this work we extend and validate the Monte Carlo (MC) simulator PeneloPET to deal with multiple-coincidences in PET scanners. Details of gamma-rays cascades from several positron-gamma emitters, such as <sup>124</sup>I, were incorporated in the simulation. Furthermore, a new tool to analyze doubles and triples datasets generated by the simulation was added to the software package. Results from simulations were first compared against data acquired with a modified version of the preclinical Argus PET/CT scanner (Sedecal S.A., Madrid, Spain), which is enabled to acquire and process multiple coincidence events. A good agreement in the energy spectra as well as in the double/triples ratio between simulations and experiments was found (differences below 10 %). Once validated, the simulator was used to evaluate the feasibility of using multiple-coincidence events in several clinical PET/CT scanners, such as the Siemens Biograph TruePoint TrueV (B-TPTV), the GE Discovery-690 and the Philips Ingenuity scanners.","1082-3654;10823654","978-1-4799-0533-1;9781479905331","","10.1109/NSSMIC.2013.6829155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829155","","Computed tomography;Data models;Detectors;Gamma-rays;Positron emission tomography;Positrons;Sensitivity","Monte Carlo methods;gamma-ray detection;iodine;positron emission tomography;radioisotope imaging;radioisotopes","<sup>124</sup>I;Monte Carlo simulator PeneloPET;gamma-ray coincidence detection;gamma-ray coincidence recording;positron annihilation;positron emission tomography;positron-gamma emitter differentiation;preclinical Argus PET-CT scanner;radiotracers;software package","","0","","16","","","Oct. 27 2013-Nov. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some previous studies recorded complaints from the users about the discomfort from wearing the devices. In addition, such a system sometimes can be interfered by the existing Wi-Fi traffic. Therefore, a sensor system that is comfortable to use and does not interfere with the existing wireless traffic is required. In this paper we present the system design that includes the probe, sensor, radio, and the receiver, for a long term heart rate monitoring system in a senior center. Our system has been deployed in a senior center since May 2012, and 63 seniors had used this system since then.

This technique is based on back-EMF zero crossing detection (ZCD) from voltage of one phase suitable for EV application. This paper presents a novel commutation technique of BLDC which significantly reduces sensing circuits and cost of motor drive. Digital PWM technique with a PI duty cycle controller is implemented for speed control. The stability of BLDC motor drive is analyzed by Lyapunov stability method. A novel condition is derived for digital PWM controller system being stable with respect to Lyapunov stability criterion. Further cost reduction is also possible by implementing proposed technique and speed controller on a single chip microcontroller.

However, these algorithms are near optimal or heuristic algorithms and solve the QoS partitioning problem for single QoS metric. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal partitioning algorithm which is capable of partitioning the end to end QoS requirement for multiple QoS metrics, additive and multiplicative, simultaneously. Extensive simulation verified the effectiveness of the algorithm compared to two QoS partitioning algorithms.

These forces can be the controlled interaction of the object and the environment or the force acting by another contacting agent. The proposed method takes advantage of the duality between the force (wrench) and velocity (twist) to determine the direction of slip velocity and magnitude of the friction force required to have local slip at the contact point(s).

It has following advantages over the existing single-phase matrix converters: 1) it can both buck and boost input voltage solving the limited voltage transfer ratio (only boost or buck) problem; 2) it also has enhanced reliability as it is immune from shoot-through problem of voltage source when all switches are turned-on simultaneously, and therefore, it has no need of PWM dead times and RC snubbers or dedicated soft-commutation strategies to solve the commutation problem; 3) it can also use high speed power MOSFETs as their body diodes never conduct, which eliminate their poor reverse recovery problem. The operation principle of the proposed converter is given, and switching strategies are developed to obtain various multiples and submultiples of input frequency.

A certain number of parameters can be selected to reduce temperature and temperature gradient. This paper is mainly focusing on the thermal impact of the die-to-die interface layer. This consists of adhesive material and arrays of interconnection structures. Besides being used for electrical die-die connections, they can be added to locally improve the low thermal conductivity of the adhesive. Short computational time is preferred for the thermal analysis of different designs: this is why various compact thermal models (CTMs) strategies have been developed. The one presented here, for the steady state temperature evaluation of two dies stacks, is based on convolution and fast Fourier transform. A novel correction methodology is introduced to deal with the material non-homogeneity in the interface layer.

We show in general how to construct a secure cloud storage protocol given any secure network coding protocol. Our construction suggests a systematic way to construct various secure cloud storage protocols. We also show that it is secure under a definition which captures the real world uses of the cloud storage. From our general construction, we propose a secure cloud storage protocol based on a recent secure network coding protocol. The protocol is the first publicly verifiable secure cloud storage protocol in the standard model, while the previous work is either not publicly verifiable, or security argument is only argued heuristically in the random oracle model. We also enhance the proposed protocol to support third-party public auditing, which has received considerable attention recently. Finally, we prototype the proposed protocol and evaluate its performance.

A genetic algorithm is then used to find a set of reactions that exhibit a pre-specified behavior. Our results show that reaction sets can be found to give polymer distributions that are biased towards longer polymers. We present examples of these protocell chemistries and show that the reaction sets found are robust in the sense that they produce desirable behavior in equilibrium.

We have recently shown that our inertial motion tracking system can capture stable kinematic data, calibrated against ground-truth over a long period of time. However, for many clinical and daily life activities, it is also essential to monitor the muscle-activity. In this study, we evaluate the long-term recording stability of our prototype mechanomyography (MMG) sensors as an extension to our existing ETHO1 body sensor network platform. We attached the MMG sensors along with commercial high-accuracy EMG electrodes on the arm muscles of 5 subjects throughout a working day of 9 hours. The subjects followed their daily routine but they had to perform a multi-level force-matching task through flexion and extension of their arm during four short sessions of the day, as measures of practical signal quality. We designed a force predictor that used either EMG or MMG signals to predict the forces generated by subjects. Our prototype low-cost MMG channels have shown comparable results (RMSE: 23N and R<sup>2</sup>: 0.91) in predicting the force levels applied when compared against the commercial high-accuracy EMG sensor (RMSE: 19N and R<sup>2</sup>: 0.95).","2376-8886;23768886","978-1-4799-4932-8;9781479949328","","10.1109/BSN.2014.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6855619","BSN-based MMG;electromyography;force prediction;long-term comparison;mechanomyography","Body sensor networks;Electromyography;Force;Kinematics;Monitoring;Muscles;Sensors","biomechanics;biomedical electrodes;body sensor networks;electromyography;mean square error methods;patient monitoring","BSN-based electromyography;BSN-based mechanomyography;EMG electrodes;EMG signal;ETHO1 body sensor network platform;MMG sensor;MMG signal;RMSE;arm extension;arm flexion;arm muscles;clinical activities;daily life activities;daily routine;day-long continuous monitoring;day-long recording stability;drift effects;force level prediction;ground-truth;high-accuracy EMG sensor;inertial motion tracking system;long-term recording stability;low-cost MMG channel;mechanomyography sensor;multilevel force-matching task;muscle force prediction;muscle-activity monitoring;practical signal quality;stable kinematic data;stable sensor;time 9 h","","4","","33","","","16-19 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, a small, relative low-cost diode laser is potentially useful to achieve PA imaging as it provides PRF up to kHz but the pulse energy of such a laser is generally too low for effective PA generation. In this study, we proposed Golay coded excitation using a diode laser to generate PA signal. A high frequency 20-MHz PA transducer integrated an optical fiber was proposed to enable backward mode ultrasound and PA detection. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the generated PA signals of different Golay code lengths (i.e., 2, 4, 16 and 256 bit) and pulse durations (i.e., 25, 50, 100 and 200 ns) were evaluated. Results show that the SNR increased with the code length and achieved from 30.8 to 37.0 dB of 256-bit code length with different pulse durations. In addition, the SNR improvement was also shown.

We propose a novel approach to detect these attack flows at edge routers. A flow exhibiting a periodic pattern is marked malicious if its burst length is greater than or equal to RTTs of other connections with the same server and its time period is equal to the fixed minimum RTO. A carefully designed light weight data structure is proposed to store the necessary flow history at edge routers.

XII Brazilian Symposium on","20020806","1999","","","93","102","This paper describes a real-time shadow generation algorithm for static polygonal environments illuminated by movable point light sources. The algorithm combines a technique of volumetric shadow rendering using stencil buffers with a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree, and includes new easy-to-implement approaches to improvement techniques used in shadow volume algorithms, such as silhouette detection to reduce the number of redundant shadow polygons and the computation of capping polygons to handle cases where the shadow volumes are clipped by the eye-view near clipping plane. Such a hybrid approach solves important limitations on the original shadow rendering algorithm, and also achieves real-time frame rates when using modest size scenes (about 500 shadow polygons), according to measurements performed on personal computers using current graphics hardware. Per-phase timing results from the implementation are provided along the text and compared with those of the standard algorithm","","0-7695-0481-7;0769504817","","10.1109/SIBGRA.1999.805714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=805714","","Computer graphics;Current measurement;Hardware;Layout;Light sources;Microcomputers;Partitioning algorithms;Performance evaluation;Rendering (computer graphics);Size measurement","real-time systems;rendering (computer graphics);tree data structures","BSP trees;binary space partitioning tree;capping polygons;eye-view near clipping plane;graphics hardware;movable point light sources;per-phase timing;personal computers;real-time frame rates;real-time shadow generation algorithm;redundant shadow polygons;scenes;shadow volume algorithms;silhouette detection;static polygonal environments;stencil buffers;volumetric shadow rendering","","4","1","26","","","1999","17 Oct 1999-20 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The required SPICE models of the components of the measurement setup are generated just once. They are based on scattering parameter measurements. These measurements are made with real RF components of the BCI test setup. In a schematic the SPICE models and the test circuit are connected according to the real test setup. At first in an AC analysis all voltages and currents are simulated by modelling the BCI clamp as an AC source with a constant stimulus of one volt. During real measurements a control computer sets the frequency-dependent amplitude of the generator. For this process, the standard DIN ISO 11452:4 specifies two test conditions: “open loop” and “closed loop”. In the virtual immunity test, all simulated voltages and currents due to the one volt stimulus are linearly scaled in order to match the real conditions using a computer-controlled frequency-dependent RF test power.

Approximating the unknown distribution law of the underlying phase functionals by a class of discrete distributions, we obtain an analytic expression for the BER of noisy phase OOK signals detected with square-law combining. The discrete distribution laws support any given number of power moments admitted by the phase functionals. These moments are exactly known and are given in closed form analytic expressions. The particular distribution laws chosen here are a pair called principal representations from the theory of Tchebycheff-Systems.

CNTs are found to be a promising material for nanoelectronics due to their sizes and unique properties. Conventional electronic devices replaced by CNT are possibly to be miniature and provide better performance, and therefore, people have focused on developing a method to produce CNT based nano devices. Electrical assembly of CNTs is one of the promising methods to manipulate the CNT in place and apply them in such applications. Since the size of CNTs is in nano scale, traditional robotic manipulation cannot be applied. Building single CNT device is challenging and therefore, most people have concentrated on manipulating bundled CNTs. However, the electrical property of bundled CNTs is difficult to control, and resulting the device cannot benefit from quantum properties of single CNT. Therefore, an automated process for manufacturing single CNT based nano devices is developed. A CNT deposition system is developed to manipulate single CNT across microelectrodes precisely and repeatedly by dielectrophoresis (DEP). Moreover, different types of CNTs can be selected by using a micro chamber to filter specific electronic property of CNTs. The system can potentially be used to fabricate an array of CNT based devices, and a fast and feasible batch nano assembly of consistent nano devices can be achieved.","1944-9399;19449399","978-1-4244-0607-4;9781424406074","978-1-4244-0608-1;9781424406081","10.1109/NANO.2007.4601235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601235","nanomanipulation;nanomanufacturing;nanotube;separation;single CNT","Automatic control;Carbon nanotubes;Dielectrophoresis;Manufacturing automation;Manufacturing processes;Microelectrodes;Nanoelectronics;Organic materials;Robotic assembly;Robotics and automation","automation;carbon nanotubes;electrophoresis;nanoelectronics;nanotube devices","automated manufacturing process;carbon nanotubes;dielectrophoresis;nanoassembly;nanodevices;nanoelectronics;nanomanipulation","","1","","26","","","2-5 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, it is attempted to perform a comprehensive review of research work done in the area of Unit Commitment (UC) under deregulated environment. In traditional UC, the objective is to produce power to satisfy the consumers with minimum production cost to meet the demand, whereas in the deregulated power market the generating companies (GENCOs) schedule their generators with a totally different objective of maximizing their profit with an inequality demand constraint. Hence this model is called as Profit/Price Based Unit Commitment (PBUC). This model is not uniform in all the countries.

On one hand, designers use technology scaling as one of the methods to face the phenomenon called dark silicon (only segments of a chip function concurrently due to power restrictions). On the other hand, designers use extreme-scale systems such as teradevices to meet the performance needs of their applications which in turn increases the power consumption of the platform. In order to overcome these challenges, we need novel computing paradigms that address energy efficiency. One of the promising solutions is to incorporate parallel distributed methodologies at different abstraction levels. The FP7 project ParaDIME focuses on this objective to provide different distributed methodologies (software-hardware techniques) at different abstraction levels to attack the power-wall problem. In particular, the ParaDIME framework will utilize: circuit and architecture operation below safe voltage limits for drastic energy savings, specialized energy-aware computing accelerators, heterogeneous computing, energy-aware runtime, approximate computing and power-aware message passing. The major outcome of the project will be a processor architecture for a heterogeneous distributed system that utilizes future device characteristics for drastic energy savings. Wherever possible, ParaDIME will adopt multidisciplinary techniques, such as hardware support for message passing, runtime energy optimization utilizing new hardware energy performance counters, use of accelerators for error recovery from sub-safe voltage operation, and approximate computing through annotated code. Furthermore, we will establish and investigate the theoretical limits of energy savings at the device, circuit, architecture, runtime and programming model levels of the computing stack, as well as quantify the actual energy savings achieved by the Par- DIME approach for the complete computing stack with the real environment.","","","","10.1109/DSD.2014.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927244","Data center;Energy minimization;Heterogeneous devices;Low-power;Programming model","Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Hardware;Message passing;Performance evaluation;Runtime;Servers","computer centres;energy conservation;energy consumption;message passing;parallel architectures;power aware computing","FP7 project;ParaDIME;approximate computing;computing devices;dark silicon;data centers;drastic energy savings;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy minimization;energy optimization;energy-aware computing accelerators;energy-aware runtime;heterogeneous computing;heterogeneous distributed system;parallel distributed infrastructure;parallel distributed methodologies;power consumption;power-aware message passing;teradevices;voltage limits","","1","","17","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key observation is that systems control theory can be used to design the optimal policy that both achieves sustainable levels of emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> (and other greenhouse gases) and minimises the impact on the economy, while explicitly addressing the high levels of uncertainty associated with predictions of future emissions. As an initial result, in this paper a test bed for the above approach - the UK 4see model - is introduced, which is suitable for using control theory to design sustainable policies for greenhouse gas emissions. The basic structure and principle of the model is described and its implementation in Matlab Simulink is presented. A linearised state space model is then obtained, analysed and further simplified via standard model reduction techniques. The model established in this paper provides a method of predicting future greenhouse gas emission levels and economic growth against different energy policies and forms the basis for future research on using systems control theory to design optimal sustainable policies.","1085-1992;10851992","978-1-4577-1062-9;9781457710629","978-1-4577-1061-2;9781457710612","10.1109/CCA.2011.6044453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6044453","","Analytical models;Carbon dioxide;Economics;Indexes;Industries;Mathematical model;Reduced order systems","air pollution control;environmental economics;environmental legislation;reduced order systems;state-space methods;sustainable development","Matlab Simulink;UK 4see model;carbon dioxide emission level;control theory;economic growth;greenhouse gas emission reduction;linearised state space model;optimal sustainable policies;standard model reduction techniques","","2","","23","","","28-30 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Strong mode confinement in the growth and in-plane directions are provided by a double-plasmon waveguide and due to the strong impedance mismatch between the gain material and air. This allows laser emission from devices with overall dimensions much smaller than the free-air emission wavelength (lambda > 100 <i>mu</i>m). Hence, for the smallest microdisks we achieved a threshold current as low as 13.5 mA (350 A/cm<sup>2</sup>) in pulsed-mode operation at 5 K and stable single-mode emission up to 95 K in continuous-wave mode operation. We have observed dynamical frequency pulling of the resonator mode on the gigahertz scale, as a consequence of the gain shift due to the quantum-confined Stark effect. Thus, we were able to estimate the peak gain of the material to 27 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The smallest microcavities exhibited a strong dependence on the exact placement of the bond wire which resulted in single- as well as double-mode emission. Finite-difference time-domain simulations were performed in order to identify the modes of the recorded spectra. They confirm that most of the observed spectral features can be attributed to the lasing emission of whispering-gallery modes.","0018-9197;00189197","","","10.1109/JQE.2007.900254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276831","Laser;microcavity;quantum-cascade;subwavelength;terahertz","Bonding;Frequency;Impedance;Laser modes;Microcavities;Optical materials;Stark effect;Threshold current;Waveguide lasers;Wire","finite difference time-domain analysis;laser modes;microcavity lasers;microdisc lasers;quantum cascade lasers;ring lasers;submillimetre wave lasers;whispering gallery modes","circular-shaped microresonators;continuous-wave mode operation;double-plasmon waveguide;dynamical frequency pulling;finite-difference time-domain simulations;free-air emission wavelength;laser emission;microcavity quantum-cascade lasers;microring terahertz quantum-cascade lasers;quantum-confined Stark effect;subwavelength microdisk;threshold current;whispering-gallery modes","","10","","48","","","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An accurate method for the computation of the RCS of active waveguide arrays is presented. It combines the plane wave angular spectrum method used by Stalzer et al. (1978) to find the active element radiation pattern of an infinite phased array and the generalized scattering matrix (GSM) approach to periodic waveguide array analysis. The active scatter pattern of an element in an infinite array is obtained in terms of the reflection coefficients of the free space Floquet modes found by the GSM procedure. This active scatter pattern is employed in the computation of the RCS of a finite array by assuming that it is identical for all elements of the array and ignoring the edge effects in the process. The accuracy of this model has been validated by the good agreement observed between predictions and published test results of arrays of various sizes.","","0-7803-5639-x;078035639x","","10.1109/APS.1999.788292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=788292","","Computer crime;Feeds;GSM;Impedance;Integral equations;Phased arrays;Planar waveguides;Radar cross section;Scattering;Waveguide discontinuities","S-matrix theory;active antenna arrays;antenna phased arrays;antenna radiation patterns;electromagnetic wave reflection;electromagnetic wave scattering;periodic structures;radar cross-sections;waveguide antenna arrays","RCS computation;active element radiation pattern;active scatter pattern;active waveguide arrays;finite array;free space Floquet modes;generalized scattering matrix;infinite array;infinite phased array;periodic waveguide array analysis;planar array;plane wave angular spectrum method;radar cross section;radar cross-section;reflection coefficients;test results","","1","","4","","","11-16 July 1999","11 Jul 1999-16 Jul 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the obtained guarded actions contain assumptions and assertions, they are directly used as proof goals in our approach. Due to a back-annotation via control flow locations, there is still a direct correspondence between the two system representations.

The load spring is designed to modify the modulation line slope in the presence of fabrication errors, thus reducing the output displacement errors. We compare three prototypes including the uncompensated design, the compensated design at the fabrication error of delta=0, and the compensated design in the fabrication error range of -0.3 mum<delta< 0, respectively. The two different compensated linear DA actuators generate the output displacement errors of -0.20plusmn0.23 mum and -0.13plusmn0.18 mum, respectively, thus reducing their output errors by 64.3% and 76.8% of the errors, i.e., 0.56plusmn0.20 mum, produced by the conventional uncompensated linear DA actuator. The dynamic characteristics of the compensated linear DA actuators show the response time below 1.5 ms, the resonant frequency of 3.7 kHz, and the lifetime of 107 cycles. Consequently, we experimentally verify the fabrication error compensation function of the compensated linear DA actuators for applications to high-accuracy actuators insensitive to fabrication errors.","1057-7157;10577157","","","10.1109/JMEMS.2007.896702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276805","Digital-to-analog (DA) actuators;fabrication errors;high-accuracy actuation;microactuators","Delay;Displays;Error compensation;Etching;Fabrication;Hydraulic actuators;Microactuators;Prototypes;Resonant frequency;Springs","digital-analogue conversion;error compensation;microactuators;springs (mechanical)","displacement errors;dynamic characteristics;fabrication error compensation;high-accuracy digital-to-analog actuators;linear load spring design;micromechanical linear DA actuator;modulation line slope","","3","","15","","","June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The first stage involves the indirect measurement of each lead displacement with respect to its ideal position, centralized on its pad region. This displacement is inferred from area measurements on the raw image data of the lead region through a classification process. To increase the accuracy in the computation of the displacement, the second stage develops a combined classification/estimation process, in which the individual lead displacement classifications are viewed as measurements (or observations) of the same physical quantity i.e., the displacement of the entire component as a rigid body.

First, we propose a new quality-driven routing scheme for delivering video streams from a fixed network to a destination vehicle via multihop communications. The routing scheme aims to optimize the visual quality of the transmitted video frames by minimizing the distortion, the start-up delay, and the frequency of the streaming freezes. We further propose an efficient network mobility management scheme, which introduces a novel adaptation of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for multi-hop VANET scenarios, and incorporates a handover prediction mechanism. Numerical results are given to demonstrate that our integrated scheme can achieve a better performance for the video quality metrics, the handover delay and the signalling cost.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5962785","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962785","","Delay;IP networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Streaming media;Vehicles","IP networks;mobility management (mobile radio);quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;vehicular ad hoc networks;video streaming","PMIPv6;Proxy Mobile IPv6;dynamic topology;handover delay;handover prediction mechanism;integrated network-layer scheme;multihop communication;network mobility management;quality-driven routing scheme;seamless quality-driven multihop data delivery;signalling cost;urban VANET;vehicular ad-hoc network;vehicular network;video quality metrics;video streaming","","9","","10","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mura defect embedded in a low-contrast surface image shows no distinct intensity from its surrounding region, and even worse, the sensed image may also present uneven illumination on the surface. All these make the mura defect detection in low-contrast surface images extremely difficult. A set of basis images derived from defect-free surface images are used to represent the general appearance of a clear surface. An image to be inspected is then constructed as a linear combination of the basis images, and the coefficients of the combination form the feature vector for discriminating mura defects from clear surfaces. In order to find minimum number of basis images for efficient and effective representation, the basis images are designed such that they are both statistically independent and spatially exclusive. An independent component analysis-based model that finds both the maximum negentropy for statistical independency and minimum spatial correlation for spatial redundancy is proposed to extract the representative basis images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can effectively detect various mura defects in low-contrast LCD panel images.","","","","10.1109/MVA.2015.7153163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153163","","Conferences;Correlation coefficient;Inspection;Machine vision;Manufacturing;Redundancy;Training","computer vision;image representation;independent component analysis;liquid crystal displays","LCD panel images;basis image representation;feature vector;independent component analysis-based model;liquid crystal display panels;low-contrast surface images;machine vision approach;maximum negentropy;minimum spatial correlation;mura defect;spatial redundancy;statistical independency;surface defect detection","","0","","8","","","18-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BCAC is dedicated for characterizing aerosols exiting in the form of short duration, high velocity plumes with a relatively wide angle of particle dispersion delivered from the dispensing device. The instrument incorporates a front-end cylindrical arrangement consisting of ten well-insulated sections. Each of these sections is comprised of a cylindrical capacitor with a coaxial wire electrode maintained at a DC potential.

In this paper, these two reactors are applied to remove two perfluorocompounds (PFCs), i.e., CF<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>, which are extensively used in semiconductor- and liquid-crystal-display-manufacturing industries. Experimental results indicated that PBR constructed by packing dielectric pellets (chemical compositions: CuO 64%, ZnO 24%, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 10%, and MgO 2% by weight) inside the DBD reactor achieved a higher CF<sub>4</sub> removal efficiency and a lower SF<sub>6</sub> removal efficiency than that of the DBD reactor. In other words, different behavior between CF<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub> removal efficiencies achieved with two different types of NTP reactors was found in this paper. To elucidate this interesting finding, the influences of the discharge power, the reactor temperature, the catalytic effect, the nature of pollutants, and the plasma characteristics of DBD and PBR were investigated. It is found that the last two factors are mainly responsible for the interesting finding. At the same discharge gap, it is well known that PBR possesses higher mean electron energy than nonpacked plasma reactor (like DBD). Nevertheless, the dissociative attachment reaction of SF<sub>6</sub> : SF<sub>6</sub> + e rarr SF<sub>5</sub> <sup>-</sup> + F plays an important role for SF<sub>6</sub> removal at low-electron-energy region. Therefore, a nonpacked plasma reactor is more suitable for SF<sub>6</sub> removal; on the contrary, a PBR with higher mean electron energy is favorable for CF<sub>4</sub> abatement. The finding provides useful information on selecting an appropriate NTP reactor for removing a specific PFC.","0093-3813;00933813","","","10.1109/TPS.2008.918675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476140","Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD);greenhouse gases (GHGs);nonthermal plasma (NTP);packed-bed reactor (PBR);perfluorocompounds (PFCs);semiconductor-manufacturing industry","","carbon compounds;discharges (electric);dissociation;plasma devices;sulphur compounds","CF<sub>4</sub>;SF<sub>6</sub>;catalytic effect;discharge gap;discharge power;dissociative attachment reaction;electron energy;liquid-crystal-display-manufacturing industries;low-electron-energy region;nonthermal plasma reactor type;packed-bed reactor;packing dielectric pellets;perfluorocompounds abatement;semiconductor-display-manufacturing industry","","4","","40","","","April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The high complexity of today's network infrastructures and the demand for reliable and robust but inexpensive networks stimulated research on evolving networks to become more autonomous and therefore reducing the need for human intervention. The presented approach is based on integrating a Monitoring, Decision-Making, and Execution (MDE) cycle into the situation aware Network Element Cognitive Manager (NECM). Accepting that the end-to-end paradigm does not hold for all mechanisms, we enable the NECM to control in-network functionality. For the prototype the NECM is complemented by the Dynamic Protocol Composition Framework (DPCF) which allows to control and execute arbitrary protocol functionality in intermediate nodes. For the experiments we considered a wireless mesh backhaul network which is likely to suffer from packet loss depending on external conditions like weather, reflections on moving objects etc. We could show that packet loss or overload have been recognized and appropriate actions have been taken. The analysis of the experiments showed that the different phases of the M-D-E cyle differ in time consumption by several orders of magnitude which requires architectures for cognitive network management to be designed to align the different processes to achieve optimal results.","","978-1-4577-0928-9;9781457709289","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095213","Future Internet;autonomic communication;cognitive network management;communication protocols;dynamic protocol composition","Automatic repeat request;Internet;Monitoring;Network topology;Ontologies;Protocols;Routing","Internet;cognitive radio;computer network management;decision making;protocols;wireless mesh networks","M-D-E cyle;cognitive future Internet element management;cognitive network management;in-network dynamic protocol composition framework;intermediate nodes;monitoring, decision-making, and execution cycle;network infrastructures;packet loss;situation aware network element cognitive manager;wireless mesh backhaul network","","0","","8","","","15-17 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel design methodology with parallel performance estimator.","","978-1-4673-8363-9;9781467383639","","10.1109/ICCE.2016.7430510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430510","","Estimation;Hardware;Indexes;Instruction sets;Multicore processing","multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;performance evaluation","multicore systems;parallel performance estimation;progress index","","","","3","","","7-11 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The partial cribbing is especially motivated by the additive noise Gaussian MAC since perfect cribbing results in the degenerated case of full cooperation between the encoders and requires an infinite entropy link. We derive a single letter characterization of the capacity of MAC with partial cribbing for the cases of causal and strictly causal partial cribbing. Several numerical examples such as quantized cribbing are presented.We further consider and derive the capacity region where the cribbing depends on actions that are function of the previous cribbed observations. In particular, we consider a scenario where the action is “to crib or not to crib” and show that a naive time-sharing strategy is not optimal.","2157-8095;21578095","978-1-4577-0596-0;9781457705960","978-1-4577-0594-6;9781457705946","10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033965","“To crib or not to crib”;Backward decoding;Block-Markov coding;Cribbing encoders;Cribbing with actions;Gaussian MAC;Partial cribbing;Quantized cribbing;Rate splitting;Superposition codes","Channel coding;Decoding;Delay;Indexes;Joints;Relays","Gaussian channels;multi-access systems;wireless channels","additive noise Gaussian MAC;controlled cribbing encoder;multiple access channel;partial cribbing encoder;quantized cribbing","","1","","12","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 5 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Motivated by a transitional scenario where legacy linear transmitters coexist with widely linear ones, this work investigates the general K-user MIMO IC in a heterogeneous (linear and widely linear) transmitter deployment. In particular, we address the maximization of the weighted sum-rate (WSR) for (widely) linear transmit filters design through the use of the complex-valued formulation. Since the maximum WSR problem is non-convex, and thus difficult to be solved, we formulate an equivalent minimum weighted mean square error problem that allows deriving closed-form expressions for (widely) linear transceivers. Then an iterative procedure is proposed, which is proven to reach a stationary point of the maximum WSR problem. Simulations show that the proposed procedure allows increasing the sum-rate as compared to coordinated linear transceiver schemes. The gains are larger and significant in two different nonexclusive conditions: as the interference level increases or when the number of antennas is low.","1053-587X;1053587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2015.2489604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296681","Heterogeneous transceivers;MIMO interference channel;improper Gaussian signaling;weighted sum-rate maximization;widely linear estimation;widely linear precoding","Covariance matrices;Integrated circuits;Interference;MIMO;Receivers;Transceivers;Transmitters","MIMO communication;iterative methods;linear codes;mean square error methods;precoding;radio transceivers;radiofrequency interference","MIMO interference channel;MSE;WLP;closed-form expressions;complex-valued formulation;coordinated linear transceiver schemes;equivalent minimum weighted mean square error problem;general k-user MIMO IC;heterogeneous transmitter deployment;interference level;iterative procedure;legacy linear transmitters;linear transmit filters design;maximum WSR problem;nonexclusive conditions;weighted sum-rate;widely linear precoding;widely linear transceivers","","","","39","","2015-10-12","Feb.1, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Common practice is to apply around 10% higher value compared to nominal voltage value. However, the values available in existing systems differ from each other. In this study, simulation software is used for simulating different no-load voltage values for a couple of 750 VDC and 1500 VDC fed systems with real line and vehicle data.

In this paper, a general approach is presented to identify the power transfer capability and bifurcation phenomena (multiple operating modes) for such systems. This is achieved using a high order mathematical model consisting of both primary and secondary resonant circuits. The primary compensation is deliberately designed to make the primary zero phase angle frequency equal the secondary resonant frequency to achieve maximum power with minimum VA rating of the supply. A contactless electric vehicle battery charger was used to validate the theory by comparing the measured and calculated operational frequency and power transfer. For bifurcation-free operation, the power transfer capability and controllability are assured by following the proposed bifurcation criteria. Where controllable operation within the bifurcation region is achievable, a significant increase in power is possible.","0278-0046;02780046","","","10.1109/TIE.2003.822038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265794","","Air gaps;Batteries;Bifurcation;Coupling circuits;Current measurement;Electric vehicles;Magnetic resonance;Mathematical model;RLC circuits;Resonant frequency","battery chargers;bifurcation;electromagnetic coupling;inductive power transmission;resonant power convertors","bifurcation phenomena;contactless battery charger;controllable operation;electric vehicle battery charger;high order mathematical model;loosely coupled inductive power transfer systems;magnetic coupling;movable secondary loads;multiple operating modes;mutual inductance coupling;power transfer capability;primary resonant circuits;secondary resonant circuits;stationary primary source;variable frequency controllers;zero phase angle frequency","","246","","10","","","Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Failure models already known and applied for discrete semiconductors can be used to determine the failure rate of the individual function blocks. These models with their known failure rates serve as a reference for the safety integrated circuit function blocks. An advantage of this approach is that the internal safety integrated circuit structure can be taken into consideration when calculating the failure probability. The paper is based on the principles of the generic standard IEC 61508 Edition 2, 2010-04.

LoDiM is based on the Extended Kalman filter - popular because of its efficiency, robustness, and typical accuracy. LoDiM, which can take advantage of modern parallel computation techniques, may be useful for other large-scale, real-time on-line and computationally-intensive state tracking systems beyond the power systems, such as weather forecasting or gas-pipeline state estimation. Although LoDiM is presented in the context of the Kalman filter, the associated measurement selection procedure is not filter-specific, i.e. it can be used with other state estimation methods such as particle and unscented filters.

The developed method is validated by simulation on the basis of an electric distribution grid.

Sonomicrometry is used to measure the distances between ultrasonic transceivers. MDS is then used to calculate the 3-D coordinates of the ultrasonic transceiver locations, including the catheter tip, from the measured distances. Feasibility of catheter tracking was initially studied using simulated data from a geometric model in which the actual coordinates of all transceivers were known. The method was then shown to be feasible in vivo by tracking a catheter-mounted piezoelectric transducer using seven reference crystals sewn to the epicardial surface of a sheep heart. Simulation results indicate that a catheter can be tracked with a root-mean-square (rms) error of 1.51±0.05 mm and an average-distance error of e=1.06±0.27 mm using 12 reference points. In vivo results showed acceptable stress values (G<0.05) for 95% of the data samples with an average-distance error of e=0.52±0.66 mm.

Mr. Buck has given this matter a great deal of study in his high-potential transmission work, and being dissatisfied with the mechanical features of a pin insulator, has devised a method of line construction involving the use of “suspension” and “strain” insulators. The suspension insulators support the line from above, hanging vertically beneath the cross-arm (or other point of suspension). The strain insulators are used at turns and at intervals of say, every mile, to support and “anchor” the line, also as pull-off insulators on curves and to dead-end lines.","0097-2444;00972444","","","10.1109/PAIEE.1907.6742112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742112","","Fitting;Flanges;Insulators;Poles and towers;Porcelain;Strain;Suspensions","","","","0","","","","","June 1907","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To meet the challenge, a multi-class network traffics should be firstly precisely modeled. Nevertheless, due to their frequent transmission among web servers, application servers and data bases in DCNs, it is hard to precisely predict the transmission path of them, which also makes precisely latency analysis becomes difficult. In this paper, we formulate a precise traffic model for DCNs, aiming to analyzing and positioning the bottleneck occurrence in terms of system latency. Firstly, a new multi-class traffic model is formulated with Network Calculus (NC), and three cases with different positioning precision of the bottleneck (i.e., the whole network, the combination of adjacent nodes, single node) is respectively analyzed. Secondly, a novel bottleneck positioning scheme for those three cases is proposed. Simulation results show our proposed traffic model and the bottleneck positioning scheme can reach a precise analysis for latency bottleneck prediction and management for multi-class traffic in DCNs.","","978-1-4673-9392-8;9781467393928","","10.1109/ISDEA.2015.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462636","DCNs;E2E Latency Bottleneck;multiclass traffic;network calculus","Analytical models;Calculus;Data models;Delays;Stochastic processes;Web servers","computer centres;computer network performance evaluation;quality of experience;telecommunication traffic","DCN;QoE;bottleneck occurrence;bottleneck positioning scheme;data center networks;end-to-end latency bottleneck analysis;latency bottleneck management;latency bottleneck prediction;multiclass network traffic;network calculus;network performance;positioning precision;quality of experience","","","","8","","","18-19 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The timing circuit consists of a square-law device followed by a narrowband filter tuned to the pulse repetition frequency along with provision for reshaping the pulses entering the timing path (prefiltering). The output of the timing circuit is a nearly sinusoidal timing wave whose zero crossings indicate the appropriate sampling instants for demodulation of the PAM signal. For a random data sequence, the timing wave exhibits phase fluctuations which are strongly dependent on the pulse shapes entering the timing path and the passband shape of the narrow-band filter. Expressions for rms phase fluctuation in the timing wave as a function of the prefiltering and postfiltering characteristics of the filters preceding and following the square-law device are presented. These expressions have a form which is especially suitable for studying the case where the baseband PAM signal is band-limited to frequencies less than the pulse repetition frequency. A condition on prefiltering and postfiltering which gives error-free timing recovery is presented. Results obtained from some specific examples serve to illustrate several aspects of the timing recovery problem.","0090-6778;00906778","","","10.1109/TCOM.1974.1092318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1092318","","Amplitude modulation;Band pass filters;Baseband;Fluctuations;Frequency;Narrowband;Pulse circuits;Pulse modulation;Shape;Timing jitter","","PAM demodulation;Timing jitters","","94","5","","","","Jul 1974","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a hybrid approach of anomaly detection based on the traffic characterization of four qualitative flow features using the Shannon entropy: IP addresses and ports of origin and destination. In order to achieve a traffic characterization of the four analyzed dimensions, we use the Holt-Winters for Digital Signature (HWDS) method. It is an improvement of the traditional method which is able to efficiently characterize the traffic, generating a Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow analysis (DSNSF) for each dimension.

The nonderivative optimizer finds the optimal wheel slips that maximize the road adhesion coefficient. The optimal wheel slips are for the front and rear wheels. The inputs to the FLC are the optimal wheel slips obtained by the nonderivative optimizer. The fuzzy components then compute brake torques that force the actual wheel slips to track the optimal wheel slips; these torques minimize the vehicle stopping distance. The FLCs are tuned using a genetic algorithm.

The available bit budget needs to be distributed across the sequences in order to meet some optimality criteria. For example, one might want to minimize the average distortion or, alternatively, minimize the distortion variance, in order to keep almost constant quality among the encoded sequences. By working in the rho-domain, we propose a low-delay rate allocation scheme that, at each time instant, provides a closed form solution for either the aforementioned problems. We show that minimizing the distortion variance instead of the average distortion leads, for each of the multiplexed sequences, to a coding penalty less than 0.5 dB, in terms of average PSNR. In addition, our analysis provides an explicit relationship between model parameters and this loss. In order to smooth the distortion also along time, we accommodate a shared encoder buffer to compensate for rate fluctuations. Although the proposed scheme is general, and it can be adopted for any video and image coding standard, we provide experimental evidence by transcoding bitstreams encoded using the state-of-the-art H.264/AVC standard. The results of our simulations reveal that is it possible to achieve distortion smoothing both in time and across the sequences, without sacrificing coding efficiency.","1057-7149;10577149","","","10.1109/TIP.2008.924278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531190","Rate control;statistical multiplexing;video coding","","distortion;smoothing methods;video coding;video streaming","distortion smoothing;distortion variance;encoded sequences;encoder buffer;image coding;multiple video streams;multiplexed H.264/AVC bitstreams;multiplexed sequences;optimal rate allocation;video coding","Algorithms;Data Compression;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Video Recording","15","4","32","","2008-05-28","July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of the reconstruction of such curves is an inverse problem, slight variations in input data completely skew the expected results. So, finding a robust reconstruction operator is highly required. We present a robust method based upon neural networks. This method takes advantage of that neural networks are generally robust to the noise. Furthermore, we propose two cascade algorithms of using these neural networks.

"Block Markov superposition transmission of convolutional codes with minimum shift keying signalling","X. Liu; C. Liang; X. Ma","Dept. of Electron. & Commun.

The BMST-MSK can be implemented in two forms - the BMST with recursive MSK (BMST-RMSK) and the BMST with non-recursive MSK (BMST-NRMSK). The BMST-MSK admits a sliding-window decoding/demodulation algorithm, where two schedules with or without iterative processing between the BMST and MSK (referred to as outer iteration) are discussed. To analyse the asymptotic performance of BMST-MSK, the authors' first assume a genie-aided decoder and then derive the union bound for the equivalent genie-aided system. Numerical results show that the performances of the BMST-MSK match well with the derived lower bounds in the low error rate regions. From simulations, the authors' found that the outer iterations can provide performance improvement for the BMST-RMSK, but not for the BMST-NRMSK. Taking a (2,1,2) convolutional code with input length of 10 000 bits as the basic code, the BMST-NRMSK achieves a bit-error-rate of 10<sup>-5</sup> at <i>E</i><sub>b</sub>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub> = 0.45 dB over additive white Gaussian noise channels, which is away from the Shannon limit about 0.25 dB.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2014.0751","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001296","","","AWGN channels;Markov processes;convolutional codes;error statistics;iterative methods;minimum shift keying;modulation coding","BMST-MSK;BMST-NRMSK;Shannon limit;additive white Gaussian noise channels;bit-error-rate;block Markov superposition transmission;convolutional codes;genie-aided decoder;iterative processing;minimum shift keying signalling;sliding-window decoding algorithm;sliding-window demodulation algorithm","","0","","","","","1 2 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Determining the location of an automatic teller machine (ATM) for deployment is also a challenging decision for banks which has not been addressed adequately in the literature up to now. Where to locate the automatic teller machines is a strategic and long-term decision therefore making the right decision is important for the banks. In this paper, both qualitative and quantitative criteria that should be considered are defined for ATM deployment problem. The criteria are categorized into main clusters in accordance with their similar characteristics and the interdependencies between them are explained. Analytic Network Process (ANP) methodology is preferred to evaluate the importance levels of these criteria. This study intends to build up a generic framework that can be used afterwards to determine the best locations for off-site ATMs of a bank which cover all customer demand and keep costs at a minimum level in ATM deployment problem. The study also covers the banks which have ATMs or do not have any ATMs and searching for the best locations in order to deploy new ATMs.","","","","10.1109/IESM.2015.7380301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380301","analytic network process;automatic teller machines;location selection;multi-criteria decision making","Companies;Credit cards;Maintenance engineering;Online banking;Remuneration;Sociology;Statistics","analytic hierarchy process;automatic teller machines;bank data processing;facility location","ANP;ATM deployment;analytic network process;automatic teller machine;decision making;facility location","","","","16","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That assists healthcare providers to have 24/7 remote patient monitoring system and assist patients to have 24 hour access to the medical care. Such systems are considered as extra tools to assist physicians and patients in controlling and managing the disease. Providing an accurate real-time recommendation for medical data is a challenge according to the complexity of the medical data represented by unbalance, large, multi-dimension, noisy and/or missing data. The CDD system expectation is to give a high accuracy of disease risk prediction and medical advices recommendation. In this paper, a CDD recommender system approach is proposed based on a hybrid method using multiple classifications and unified Collaborative Filtering. Multiple classifications based on decision tree algorithms are applied to buildan accurate predictive model that predicts the disease risk diagnosis for the monitored cases. The Unified CF method based on learning classification model using both historical binary ratings and external features will be utilized for achieving higher recommendation accuracy [1] when recommending medical advices for patients.Historical patients' medical data from the Middle East is used to train the model. Determining the relevant features through Attribute Selection method is used toreducedata generation and improve the predictive model performance. Merging patients' lab and home test readings is considered to leverage the diagnosis fidelity. Diabetes diagnosis case study is designed as experiments to show the feasibility of our model. To the written of this paper, multiple decision tree classifiers have been applied through the first stage of CDD system to achieve high accuracypredictive model.

An important issue for the operation of large arrays is the accuracy with which signals from hundreds of small antennas can be combined. This is particularly true at Ka band (32 GHz) where atmospheric phase variations can be large and rapidly changing. A number of algorithms exist to correct the phases of signals from individual antennas in the case where a spacecraft signal provides a useful signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on time scales shorter than the atmospheric coherence time. However, for very weak spacecraft signals it will be necessary to rely on background natural radio sources to maintain array phasing. Very weak signals could result from a spacecraft emergency or by design, such as direct-to-Earth data transmissions from distant planetary atmospheric or surface probes using only low gain antennas. This paper considers the parameter space where external real-time phase calibration will be necessary, and what this requires in terms of array configuration and signal processing.

This paper is intended to fill this gap for fault analysis. User can choose or add the system he/she wants to work on and display the bus voltages and fault currents. This GUI lets users change the faulted phases and buses and at the same time observe the changes in the system operation under fault conditions. This interface is developed under MATLAB 7.

It is also shown that if the inverters are converted into odd number of UE's then they become contributing UE's which can be used to improve skirt slopes considerably.

Unlike the conventional methods that depend on information from both spatial and frequency domains, the proposed method operates solely in the frequency domain by exploiting the pixel value patterns represented by the corresponding DCT basis vectors. In particular, each block is classified into five categories, namely, complex-pattern, complex-nonpattern, simple-smooth, simple-pattern and simple-texture, and each is treated differently using the proposed predictor. The proposed sign prediction method is then applied to realize reversible data embedding using sign information in a scrambled JPEG compressed image. This work is the first of its kind in using sign information for data embedding purposes. Basic performance of the proposed sign prediction and the proposed reversible data embedding method in scrambled JPEG image are verified using standard test images.","1522-4880;15224880","","","10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738915","DCT basis vector;Sign prediction;data embedding;reversible;scrambling","","discrete cosine transforms;frequency-domain analysis;image coding","DCT basis vectors;DCT coefficients;DCT sign prediction method;complex-nonpattern category;complex-pattern category;data embedding purpose;frequency domain;pixel value patterns;reversible data embedding method;scrambled JPEG compressed image;scrambled JPEG image;sign information;simple-pattern category;simple-smooth category;simple-texture category;spatial domain;standard test images","","0","","14","","","15-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A technique is proposed that combines periodic interleaving with noise-predictive DFE, so that delayed reliable decisions can be used for feedback.

Each operation supported by a Web service is associated with a semantic annotation that describes the input and output messages using RDF graph patterns. The terms used in these patterns are defined in OWL ontologies that describe the application domain. A key difference between our model and existing semantic Web service models like OWLS is that it describes the inputs and outputs in terms of instance-based graph patterns, rather than in terms of concepts. This allows associating a rich set of constraints on the input and output data in terms of relations between instances. We also propose a composition model for Web service operations, that describes the conditions for composing services into workflows. The composition model includes the notion of semantic propagation, i.e. the semantic description of the output message of an operation depends on the semantics of the input message. We have developed a planner that uses this model to compose services, automatically. The planner uses DLP reasoning to aid plan search. We present performance results for the planner.","","0-7695-2924-0;0769529240","","10.1109/ICWS.2007.129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4279585","","Data analysis;Data processing;Joining processes;OWL;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantic Web;Web services","Web services;graph grammars;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","OWL ontologies;RDF graph patterns;Web ontology language;Web service modeling;automatic composition model;instance-based graph pattern;semantic Web service model;semantic annotation;semantic graph transformation;semantic propagation","","7","","19","","","9-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of serving a single end-user, a multi-tenant SaaS provides multiple end-users with the same functionality but with potentially different quality-of-service (QoS) values. The service selection for such a SaaS is a complex decision-making process which involves a number of stakeholders with different QoS requirements. SaaS developers need to compose services with different QoS values to meet end-users' different multidimensional QoS constraints for the SaaS. Furthermore, they also need to satisfy SaaS providers' optimisation goals for the SaaS, such as least resource cost and best system performance. Existing QoS-aware service selection approaches are oriented at a single tenant. They do not consider the characteristics of multi-tenant SaaS and hence are ineffective and inefficient when applied to compose multi-tenant SaaS. In this paper, we introduce a novel QoS-driven approach for helping SaaS developers select the services for composing multi-tenant SaaS, which achieves SaaS providers' optimisation goals while fulfilling the end-users' different levels of QoS constraints. The proposed approach is evaluated using an example SaaS synthetically generated based on a dataset of real-world Web services. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both effectiveness and performance.","2159-6182;21596182","978-1-4673-2892-0;9781467328920","","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253552","Cloud computing;Quality of Service;SaaS;multi-tenancy;optimisation;service composition","Business;Greedy algorithms;Linear programming;Optimization;Quality of service;Time factors;Web services","Web services;cloud computing;quality of service","QoS-driven service selection;Web engineering;cloud-based software applications;complex decision-making process;multitenant SaaS;quality-of-service values;real-world Web services;software as a service","","13","","19","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the MIMO case the S-procedure is known to obtain only sufficient conditions for existence of the Lur'e-Postnikov function. So, the multivariable extension of the Popov criterion derived on its base is too conservative. We use a non-conservative extension of the S-procedure which makes it possible to derive a new absolute stability criterion which is less conservative than the multivariable Popov criterion.

For each hop (v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>), communication is effective only when v<sub>i</sub> is transmitting, v<sub>j</sub> is receiving, and no other node in proximity of v<sub>j</sub> is also transmitting. Since sensor nodes are prone to failure, the schedules should be independent of the detailed topology while supporting spatial reuse. We use arc-decompositions of the complete lambda-fold directed graph Koarr<sub>n</sub> into directed complete bipartite subgraphs Koarr<sub>a,b</sub> as a model for ternary scheduling in WSNs. We associate the vertices of Koarr<sub>n</sub> with the nodes of the WSN, and occurrences of Koarr<sub>a,b</sub>s (blocks) in the decomposition with time slots in the schedule. A block with out-vertices A and in-vertices B corresponds to a slot in which the a nodes in A are transmitting, the b in B are receiving, and all others are asleep.

"Permittivity measurement technique for a dielectric strip using a rectangular waveguide","Tsenchieh Chin","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Central Univ., Chung-li, Taiwan","Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium, 2001. IEEE","20020807","2001","3","","314","317 vol.3","A measurement technique for a dielectric strip using a rectangular waveguide is developed for complex permittivity retrieval. The width of the strip is generally narrow, so the sample may not be able to fill the whole waveguide cross section, as shown. When the measured reflection coefficient is too high, or another independent measurement is needed, in addition to changing the size of the sample, it can also be achieved by tilting the sample. A forward scattering solution for the tilted strip in a rectangular waveguide is first constructed using the finite element method as a reference. Then the image theory is applied to make the original configuration as an infinite 2D array of strips. The scattering from the new configuration is solved using the method of moments. Infinite terms of multiple scattering interactions between strips should appear in the complete solution. After a comparison to the finite element solution, an appropriate sample position of the strip in the waveguide can be suggested in which the least terms of the multiple scattering interactions need to be considered. The final forward model is then used in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to retrieve the parameters of interest. Numerical simulation for sensitivity analysis is presented, and the retrieving technique is validated by measuring samples with known properties.","","0-7803-7070-8;0780370708","","10.1109/APS.2001.960095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=960095","","Dielectric measurements;Finite element methods;Measurement techniques;Moment methods;Permittivity measurement;Rectangular waveguides;Reflection;Scattering;Size measurement;Strips","S-matrix theory;dielectric materials;electromagnetic wave reflection;electromagnetic wave scattering;finite element analysis;genetic algorithms;method of moments;permittivity measurement;rectangular waveguides","complex permittivity retrieval;dielectric strip;finite element method;forward scattering solution;genetic algorithm;image theory;infinite 2D array;measured reflection coefficient;method of moments;multiple scattering interactions;numerical simulation;permittivity measurement;rectangular waveguide;sensitivity analysis;tilted strip","","1","","3","","","8-13 July 2001","08 Jul 2001-13 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High throughput is directly related to mission complexity and the degree of vehicle autonomy. Complex acoustic and optical sensors must be interpreted in real time and decisions based on uncertain data must be formulated and executed. Unexpected occurrances including environmental anomalies and enemy threats force immediate action and revised tactical mission planning. The development of the Autonomous Command and Control Demonstration (ACCD) system as a component development of the Autonomus Underwater Vehicle (AUV) program by Lockheed Advanced Marine Systems (AMS) has estimated peak rates greater than 100 MIPS are required for Command and Control processing. The processing itself will be a combination of signal, algorithmic and symbolic processing. Both deterministic and probabalistic algorithms will require computation. For vehicle operations in a fully autonomous mode, any component failures must be corrected by an automated fault tolerant system. The AUV software architecture, developed as part of a detailed analysis, established the performance requirements for the Command and Control hardware. The characteristics of various hardware architectures such as distributed, common memory, data flow, systolic, and connection type systems were established and assessed to determine the hardware best suited to the software structure. A heterogeneous hypercube was found to be optimum. The hypercube is reconfigurable for fault tolerance, is flexible, and can achieve high throughputs with low power and without special cooling systems. AMS will use a commercially-available hypercube as the basis of their Command and Control Architecture for an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle. This hypercube has a 32 bit architecture, extremely high message passing capability and will have image processing accelerators working in conjunction with standard cube nodes. Both symbolic and algorithmic processing will take place on the standard nodes. In this paper, system requirements, software hierarchy, computer architecture analysis and the resulting hypercube design will be discussed in detail.","","","","10.1109/UUST.1987.1158567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158567","","Command and control systems;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Hypercubes;Multiprocessing systems;Remotely operated vehicles;Throughput;Underwater vehicles","","","","1","","13","","","Jun 1987","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Disruption tolerant network (DTN) technologies are designed to enable nodes in such environments to communicate with one another. In an earlier work, we studied information retrieval schemes for single-attribute queries in DTNs. Our schemes disseminate replicated data copies and queries to local-neighborhood. However, data items often have multiple attributes and not every node can be trusted to store replicated data or queries. Thus, in this paper, we study the scenario where the queries have multiple attributes. In addition, we compare the effectiveness of using opportunistically encountered nodes or specially deployed index and storage points (ISPs) for storing replicated data items or indices of the data items. Specifically, we conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate three information retrieval schemes namely (a) the pre-determined ISP advertisement (PISA) scheme where ISPs advertise indices of data items with attribute values that fall within some pre-determined ranges, (b) the opportunistic regular node advertisement with index duplication (ORNA-ID) scheme which uses opportunistically encountered nodes for advertising replicated indices, and (c) the opportunistic regular node advertisement with data duplication (ORNA-DD) scheme which uses opportunistically encountered nodes for storing replicated data items. Our results indicate that the ORNA-ID scheme and the PISA scheme achieve similar performance. This shows that either architecture can be used. In addition, the ORNA-DD scheme provides 91% more query success rate and 128% more overall success rate in the sparsest network scenario (40 nodes distributed over 4000times4000 m<sup>2</sup>).","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-2676-8;9781424426768","978-1-4244-2677-5;9781424426775","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753337","content-based routing;disruption tolerant networking;information retrieval;multi-attribute queries","Ad hoc networks;Advertising;Bandwidth;Batteries;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Disruption tolerant networking;Energy storage;Information retrieval;Routing","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;information retrieval;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability","DTN;disruption tolerant network;index and storage points;information retrieval schemes;mobile ad hoc networks;multiattribute queries;opportunistic regular node advertisement with data duplication;opportunistic regular node advertisement with index duplication","","2","","18","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 2007 we introduced the Wireless Resonant Magnetic Micro-actuator (WRMMA) and its application in a successful microrobotic platform, the MagMite. The term MagMite is derived from Magnetic Mite-a tribute to the underlying magnetic propulsion principle and the microscale dimensions of the robot. The device harvests magnetic energy from the environment and effectively transforms it into impact-driven mechanical force while being fully controllable. It can be powered and controlled with oscillating fields in the kHz range and strengths as low as 2 mT, which is only roughly 50 times the average earth magnetic field. These microrobotic agents with dimensions less than 300 μm × 300 μm × 70 μm are capable of moving forward, backward and turning in place while reaching speeds in excess of 12.5 mm/s or 42 times the robot's body length per second. The robots produce enough force to push micro-objects of similar sizes and can be visually servoed through a maze in a fully automated fashion. The devices exhibit an overall degree of flexibility, controllability and performance unmatched by other microrobots reported in the literature. The robustness of the MagMites leads to high experimental repeatability, which in turn enabled them to successfully compete in the RoboCup 2007 and 2009 Nanogram competitions. In this video contribution we offer an integrated explanation of the non-intuitive MagMite actuation principle. This is achieved with the help of computer animation in direct comparison with real experimental footage. Furthermore, new recordings of the microrobots operating under dry and wet conditions while performing automated microhandling tasks are presented.","1050-4729;10504729","978-1-4244-5038-1;9781424450381","978-1-4244-5040-4;9781424450404","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509678","","Earth;Force control;Magnetic devices;Magnetic fields;Magnetic resonance;Micromagnetics;Propulsion;Robotics and automation;Robots;Turning","environmental factors;impact (mechanical);microactuators;microrobots","impact driven mechanical force;magnetic energy;magnetic mite;magnetic propulsion principle;microrobot;nonintuitive MagMite actuation principle;wireless microhandling;wireless resonant magnetic microactuator","","2","","11","","","3-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the real-time representation of this data in the form of tangible haptic experience has not been challenged enough, especially in the case of telepresence for individuals with visual impairments. Thus, the proposed system addresses the real-time haptic exploration of remote 3D information through video encoding and real-time 3D haptic rendering of the remote real-world environment. This paper investigates two scenarios in haptic telepresence, i.e., mobile navigation and object exploration in a remote environment. Participants with and without visual impairments participated in our experiments based on the two scenarios, and the system performance was validated. In conclusion, the proposed framework provides a new methodology of haptic telepresence for individuals with visual impairments by providing an enhanced interactive experience where they can remotely access public places (art galleries and museums) with the aid of haptic modality and robotic telepresence.","1939-1412;19391412","","","10.1109/TOH.2015.2460253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165667","3D haptic rendering;3D haptic rendering,;Haptic telepresence;assistive robotics;depth sensors;multimedia streaming;video encoding;visual impairment","Haptic interfaces;Image color analysis;Robot sensing systems;Streaming media;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization","handicapped aids;haptic interfaces;image sensors;mobile robots;museums;robot vision;telerobotics","3D spatial information;RGB-D sensor;art galleries;haptic interface;haptic telepresence system;mobile navigation;museums;object exploration;point clouds;public places;real-time 3D haptic rendering;remote environment;rich visual observation;robotic telepresence;tangible haptic experience;telepresence robot;telerobotic haptic exploration;visual impairments","","0","","64","","2015-07-23","July-Sept. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this issue, we have developed and tested new techniques for identifying potential areas of groundwater impingement into surface waters, as well as techniques for quantifying the flow rates and contaminant levels of groundwater at the surface water interface. To identify potential areas where groundwater is entering the surface water, we have developed the Trident Probe, a simple direct-push system equipped with temperature, conductivity and water sampling probes. Contrast in temperature and conductivity between surface water and groundwater are used to determine likely areas of groundwater impingement. The water-sampling probe can then be used to collect samples for detailed chemical characterization of contaminants. Once areas are identified, groundwater exchange rates and contaminant fluxes can be directly quantified using a seepage meter system that incorporates continuous flow monitoring and water sampling capabilities. The seepage meters are placed at the sediment-water interface for a period of 1-4 days and record a record of the water flow across the interface. A programmable sampling system is then used to collect the seepage water samples for subsequent chemical analysis. Recent results from sites in San Diego Bay, CA show that groundwater migration can be an important process in contaminant mobility at the interface between surface water and sediment.","","0-7803-7534-3;0780375343","","10.1109/OCEANS.2002.1191955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191955","","Chemicals;Conductivity;Exchange rates;Monitoring;Probes;Sampling methods;Sea measurements;Surface contamination;Temperature;Testing","geochemistry;groundwater;marine pollution;oceanographic techniques;sediments","California;San Diego Bay;Trident Probe;chemical analysis;coastal landfill;conductivity probe;contaminant chemical characterization;contaminant flux;contaminant mobility;continuous flow monitoring;direct-push system;groundwater exchange rate;groundwater impingement;groundwater migration;groundwater-borne contaminant;groundwater-surface water interface;hazardous waste site;potential environmental threat;programmable sampling system;sediment-water interface;seepage meter system;temperature sampling probe;water flow rate quantification;water sampling capability;water sampling probe;water-contaminant exchange","","0","1","12","","","29-31 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Any satisfying assignment to this equation specifies a complete detailed routing. By representing the equation as a binary decision diagram (BDD), we represent all possible routes for all nets simultaneously. Routability estimation is transformed to Boolean satisfiability, which is trivial for BDD's. We use the technique in the context of a perfect routability estimator for a global router.

In the process of formulating SIFT description, this paper makes a detailed research on how to calculate the lower matching pints and marginal points, adjust the threshold of the feature matching parameters and increase the matching points numbers automatically, based on the number of the exiting matching points and their distribution conditions. In this experiment, the number of feature points increases with the decrease of the threshold of low contrast points, and edge response points, which shows the similar changes in the Law of Inverse; While in the process of automatic matching, the number of feature points increases with the increase of radio value of the farthest distance of the feature points to the nearest distance, showing almost directly proportional to the law. In general, as the number of matching points increase, the accuracy and the stability of the matching would decrease. This paper proposes a threshold weight of the adaptive algorithm to improve the accuracy and robustness of the matching points and solves the problems described above. Therefore, the multi-source remote sensing images are generally divided into the images with same resolution and those with different resolutions. When the reference image and the uncorrected image have the same resolution, the connection lines of the matching points will have the same distance and slope. By contract, when the resolution of the reference image and that of the uncorrected images are different, their connection lines of matching points will intersect. This paper, studying this geometric constrain- t conditions, suggests a fast mismatching points' rejected method based on rough fuzzy C-Means cluster theory.

Since membership functions regarding change-in-error e&dot; represent the feedback of velocity, they strongly affect transient behaviors of a system. In the paper, therefore, such membership functions are parameterized by the use of the cubic splines. Then, neural networks are adopted to optimize them in self-organizing process. The proposed control scheme consists of a traditional fuzzy logic (FL) controller and a conventional derivative (D) controller. The FL controller is used as a main controller to improve transient behaviors, e.g., a small maximum overshoot and a fast settling time, whereas the D controller is used as an auxiliary controller which is helpful for stabilizing system responses. To demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method, this self-organizing fuzzy controller is used to control a manipulator","","0-7803-2129-4;0780321294","","10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=400111","","Control systems;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy neural networks;Intelligent systems;Laboratories;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Organizing;Process control;Robust control;Shape control","fuzzy control;fuzzy neural nets;neurocontrollers;self-adjusting systems;self-organising feature maps","auxiliary controller;change-in-error;cubic splines;derivative controller;efficient self-organizing fuzzy controller;fast settling time;fuzzy logic controller;manipulator;membership functions;neural networks;self-organizing process;small maximum overshoot;transient behaviors;velocity feedback","","5","","11","","","2-5 Oct 1994","02 Oct 1994-05 Oct 1994","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These devices are well-suited for digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms that are often used on orbit, providing the speedup of custom hardware without the cost of fabricating an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). SRAM FPGAs store the circuit in radiation-tolerant SRAM and SEUs can affect both the circuit functionality and the circuit state. Triple-modular redundancy (TMR) can be used to mask SEUs so that malfunctioning circuitry will not affect the output data. Unfortunately, applying TMR to a user circuit is difficult and unprotected cross-section is possible due to problems with the circuit design, device constraints, or the implementation of the user circuit on the FPGA. Given the complexity of these designs, estimating hardness assurance issues is not simple. This paper will present a tool, called the scalable tool for the analysis of reliable circuits (STARC), that can automatically estimate unprotected cross-section and other hardness assurance issues for TMR-protected circuits.","0018-9499;00189499","","","10.1109/TNS.2008.2006750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4723751","Fault identification;reliability analysis","Application specific integrated circuits;Costs;Digital signal processing;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Random access memory;Redundancy;SRAM chips;Signal processing algorithms;Single event transient","SRAM chips;application specific integrated circuits;circuit complexity;circuit reliability;digital signal processing chips;field programmable gate arrays","ASIC;FPGA devices;SRAM;application-specific integrated circuit;digital signal processing algorithm;field programmable gate array;hardness assurance estimation;radiation-tolerant circuit;scalable tool for the analysis of reliable circuits;space-based computational platform;static random access memory;triple-modular redundancy","","10","","22","","","Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We obtain up to 50% reduction for a minimal loss in total throughput. Secondly, a modified algorithm is proposed to support multi-class users. The results show that priority for distant users requesting high data rates can be maintained with no significant decrease in throughput. The compromise between short-term fairness ensured by our algorithm and long-term fairness taking benefit of mobility is also studied and compared. Moreover, to be able to support high priority users even when they undergo bad channel conditions, we implement two transmit diversity schemes, an open-loop method and a closed-loop method.

In many of these applications, reliability and availability are of utmost importance. It is therefore necessary to closely scrutinize a complex storage system's reliability characteristics. In this paper, we use Markov models to rigorously demonstrate the effects that failure prediction has on a system's mean time to data loss (MTTDL) given a parameterized sensitivity. We devise models for a single hard drive, RAID1, and N+1 type RAID systems. We find that the normal SMART failure prediction system has little impact on the MTTDL, but striking results can be seen when the sensitivity of the predictor reaches 0.5 or more. In past research, machine learning techniques have been proposed to improve SMART, showing that sensitivity levels of 0.5 or more are possible by training on past SMART data alone. The results of our stochastic models show that even with such relatively modest predictive power, these failure prediction algorithms can drastically extend the MTTDL of a data storage system. We feel that these results underscore the importance and need for complex prediction systems when calculating impending hard drive failures.","1526-7539;15267539","978-1-4244-2817-5;9781424428175","978-1-4244-2818-2;9781424428182","10.1109/MASCOT.2008.4770560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770560","","Aggregates;Availability;Fault tolerant systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Memory;Power system modeling;Predictive models;Reliability;Stochastic systems","Markov processes;RAID;disc drives;failure analysis;fault tolerance;hard discs","MTTDL;Markov model;RAID system;SMART failure prediction system;complex data storage system reliability;proactive fault tolerance;stochastic model","","7","","20","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, it enables to get images of the potential distribution on the surface of the sensing plate as the distribution of THz amplitude. Here, we demonstrate the detection of the immune reactions between the mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG).

Separate one-dimensional (1-D) functions for the axial and lateral profiles were first estimated using higher-order spectral methods. Subsequently, deconvolution was implemented using a regularized inverse Wiener filtering of the wavelet and scaling coefficients that were obtained after a wavelet decomposition of the RF signals. Deconvolution was first performed in the axial direction, then in the lateral direction. The methods were applied to data obtained from the skin of 16 volunteers using three different transducers.

Compared with the traditional task of face recognition in images, recognizing faces in unconstrained videos is much more challenging due to the large variations in poses, expressions and lighting conditions. To handle varying poses in the videos, in this paper, we propose a two-level representation approach for face verification in unconstrained videos. Specifically, we first recover the full-pose face representation for each video which contains all the pose categories ranging from the most left to the most right profile faces. The missing poses are synthesized using keyframes of known ones. Then, we further propose a cross-pose video pair representation for face verification task, which consists of the similarity scores of all frame-level pairs across two videos. Extensive experiments on the benchmark YouTube Faces (YTF) dataset clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","1522-4880;15224880","","","10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738766","Face recognition;video representation","","face recognition;image representation;pose estimation;social networking (online);video signal processing","YTF dataset;YouTube faces dataset;cross-pose video pair representation;face recognition;face verification;frame-level pair similarity scores;full-pose face representation;pose-robust representation;two-level representation approach;unconstrained videos","","1","","31","","","15-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cognitive networking techniques root in the capability of mining large amounts of mobile traffic data collected in the network, so as to understand the current resource utilization in an automated manner. In this paper, we take a first step towards cellular cognitive networks by proposing a framework that analyzes mobile operator data, builds profiles of the typical demand, and identifies unusual situations in network-wide usages. We evaluate our framework on two real-world mobile traffic datasets, and show how it extracts from these a limited number of meaningful mobile demand profiles.

Two nodes (or aspects) in the aspect graph are connected by an arc if it is possible to directly move from a viewpoint in which the first aspect is visible to a viewpoint in which the second aspect is visible. Qualitatively, we can envision a tracking strategy which simply tracks an object as it moves from one node to another in the object's aspect graph.

The authors are not aware of any published results on this problem prior to Anderson's work (in preparation). He derives a lower bound on the maximum in ν of the rms value of the convolution of f(x)e<sup>iνx</sup> and g(x) where f and g are square integrable functions, the lower bound being expressed in terms of the energy bandwidth of f and g. In this correspondence, these results are used to obtain a lower bound on the maximum in τ and ν of the envelope of the crosscorrelation function between two real, bandpass, time-limited signals when one is frequency shifted by ν, assuming that the signals are in the same passband. The lower bound is expressed in terms of a notion of ϵ-approximete energy bandwidth. By using a similar approach, and defining a bandwidth measure given by Zakai (1960) a different lower bound is obtained. Furthermore, this approach yields an upper and lower bound on the rms value of the envelope of the cross-correlation function. For the special case when the signals have identical energy spectral densities, the rms value of the envelope of the cross-correlation function is related to the timebandwidth product of the signals and is independent of the phase characteristics of their Fourier transforms.","0018-9448;00189448","","","10.1109/TIT.1967.1054020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1054020","","","","Correlation functions","","0","","3","","","July 1967","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Finer system integration technology, either via Through Silicon Stack (TSS) and/or Through Silicon Interposer (TSI), involves tighter evaluation of the coupling effects in the system-wide PDN impedance and Signal Integrity (SI) characteristics. If these interactions are not properly accounted early in the design cycle, undesired design loop iterations, affecting design productivity is possible. Therefore, new tools and flows incorporating abstracted physical information of the PDN and signal interconnect stack architecture are needed for early design exploration.

We hypothesized that the first-pass parsing processes are highly automatic, whereas second-pass parsing processes are more controlled. To test this hypothesis we varied the proportion of correct sentences and sentences containing phrase structure violations with incorrect sentences being either of a low (20% violation) or a high (80% violation) proportion. Results showed that the early left anterior negativity was elicited and equally pronounced under both proportion conditions. By contrast, the late positivity was elicited for a low proportion of incorrect sentences only. This data pattern suggests that first-pass parsing processes are automatic, whereas second-pass parsing processes are under participants' strategic control.","0898-929X;0898929X","","","10.1162/089892999563328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787937","","","","","","0","","","","","March 1999","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Standard statistical theory says normalized MLE is asymptotically normal with mean zero and variance being a function of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) at the unknown parameter. Two common estimates for the variance of MLE are the observed FIM (same as Hessian of negative log-likelihood) and the expected FIM, both of which are evaluated at the MLE given sample data. We show that, under reasonable conditions, the expected FIM tends to outperform the observed FIM under a mean-squared error criterion.

In particular, the objective of these models is to study and evaluate the steady state performance of the congestion control protocol operation of Message Transfer Part - level 3 independent of interac tions in the backbone transport network. Therefore, our performance metric deals with messages in contrast to calls. Our analytical model incorporates multiple priority message sources at the signaling points and studies congestion at a single outgoing link of a signaling transfer point. Rea sonable simplifying assumptions are made in order to develop a Markov model to approximate the performance. Two simulation models are also presented to substantiate the assumptions and verify the analytical model. Through the Markov model and simulations we investigate the normalized throughput and blocking probabilities for each of the two priority messages, as well as other mea sures odel, e.g. offered load, buffer onset threshold ratio, ratio of traffic from different priority classes, and timers are varied. We also compare the multiple priority congestion control scheme with the no-priority case. In addition, by using the second set of simulations, we show that the basic timer of the congestion control mechanism, though a deterministic value in real implementa tion, may be approximated to obey an exponential interarrival distribution without causing major errors. These simulations also show that the mean interarrival time between the expirations of this timer is a function of the offered load, and becomes essentially constant after a critical value of the offered load is exceeded. Since the behavior of this timer is critical to the imbedded Markov chain analysis, where the process is observed after each departure epoch, formulation of the imbedded Ma;rkov chain then becomes possible.","","","","10.1109/CAMAD.1994.765644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=765644","","Analytical models;Control system synthesis;Intelligent networks;Measurement;Signal analysis;Spine;Steady-state;Throughput;Traffic control;Transport protocols","","","","0","","","","","24-27 April 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an efficient approach to realize TSC-OPF by introducing an independent dynamics simulation algorithm into the optimization procedure. In the new approach, the simulation algorithm is used to realize the dynamic constraints and to deduce the transient stability constraint, while the optimization algorithm verifies the steady state and the transient stability constraints together. The new TSC-OPF has just one more constraint than that of a conventional OPF and can be solved by a conventional OPF algorithm with small modification. In the new approach, there is no limitation for the machine model and the simulation method. The nonlinearity of the power system is taken fully into account. In the paper, the proposed approach is verified with a small three-machines system. The simulation results show the machine model influences greatly the system transient stability and the TSC-OPF results.

The AQC produced a good peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) with high bit per pixels (bpp). The aim of this paper is to present algorithms with low bit rate whilst preserving the PSNR and image quality to an acceptable range. The experiments were performed using different kinds of standard color images, multi level quantizers, different thresholds, different block sizes, and different wavelet filters. Both algorithms considered the intensity variation of each colour plane. The results obtained showed a good reduction in bpp compared with the AQC algorithm, with a little loss in PSNR due to the dropping of some blocks that claimed to be low intensity variation according to a comparison with predefined thresholds for each colour plane.","","978-1-4244-8858-2;9781424488582","978-1-86135-369-6;9781861353696","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580322","","Bit rate;Discrete wavelet transforms;Filtering algorithms;Image coding;Image color analysis;PSNR;Quantization","adaptive codes;block codes;data compression;discrete wavelet transforms;image coding;image colour analysis;image segmentation;quantisation (signal)","AQC algorithm;DWT;IBAQC algorithm;adaptive quantization coding;colour image compression;discrete wavelet transforms;image quality;multi level quantizers;multilevel block truncation coding;performance improvement algorithm;wavelet filters","","2","","11","","","21-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional wisdom suggests that lossless delivery of VBR video using the CBR service requires bandwidth to be reserved at the peak rate resulting in low bandwidth utilization. We calculate the minimum rate at which bandwidth must be reserved on a network in order to provide continuous playback of an MPEG encoded video bitstream. Simulation results using the frame size traces from several pre-encoded MPEG bitstreams and several buffer sizes demonstrate that this “minimum reservation rate” is much lower than the peak rate when a modest playback buffer size is used, resulting in much higher bandwidth utilization. Procedures for performing connection setup and lossless realtime video playback between the video server and the client are outlined. Methods for incorporating VCR-like features such as “pause” and “fast forward/reverse” for video-on-demand (VoD) applications are presented","","0-7803-3250-4;0780332504","","10.1109/ICC.1996.533642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=533642","","Bandwidth;Bit rate;Codecs;Discrete cosine transforms;Network servers;Resource management;Streaming media;Telecommunication traffic;Transform coding;Video compression","buffer storage;interactive systems;interactive television;minimisation;visual communication","ATM network;CBR service;MPEG encoded video bitstream;VCR-like features;bandwidth;bandwidth utilization;buffer sizes;connection setup;continuous playback;fast forward;frame size;lossless realtime video playback;minimum rate;minimum reservation rate;pause;pre-encoded MPEG VBR video;reverse;video-on-demand","","2","12","10","","","23-27 Jun 1996","23 Jun 1996-27 Jun 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) produces the soft switching control strategy for the proposed topology. The proposed system involves a Stand-Alone Photovoltaic System, Boost converters, Fuzzy Logic Controller, Three Phase inverter and a load. The regulated voltage and current from the boost converter is fed to the inverter circuit which is connected to the load with a continuous maximum power. The fuzzy logic controller is used to improve the boost converter efficiency and the sinusoidal PWM is used to give pulses for the inverter circuit. The inverter output current for driving a load should be noted such that it does not carry the harmonic content. However since disturbed sine wave is unavoidable under various factors it is necessary to reduce the harmonic level to obtain a highly effective output.

The initial problem in such 3DV systems is the interdependency between view capturing, coding and view synthesis. For evaluating each component separately, we first generate results from the coding stage only, where color and depth coding is carried out separately. In the next step, we add the view synthesis stage with reliability-based view synthesis and show, how the separate coding results influence the view synthesis quality and what type of artifacts are produced. Efficient bit rate distribution between color and depth is investigated by objective as well as subjective evaluations. Furthermore, quality characteristics across the viewing range for different bit rate distributions are analyzed.

So, the authors developed an analytical model for interference caused by a single inquiring node, and extended the model to account for interference levels due to multiple inquirers. The authors further validated the analytical model through a simulation scenario and found that the probability of packets interfered and disrupted during inquiry procedure is periodic by repeating every 3.16 s.

So we defined a metrics assessing the Total Demand Load (TDL) of healthcare treatment in the PED which is more robust to reflect the whole patients' healthcare demand than the simple attending patients count. In addition, we demonstrate that we have to avoid being limited on the physical presence of patients because a high occupancy rate does not necessarily mean that there is a high demand of healthcare treatment. This study was based on Length Of Stay (LOS) estimation according to the patient diagnostic and his number of additional tests. The patient process progression is modeled by a time buffer system allowing the instantly track of each patient. It is a way to improve the quality of service and information delivery. This method offers a priority mechanism, it is also a robust management and decision aided tool. Besides, the time buffers system will encourage physicians to respect the time needed for each patient profile suggested in order to maximize the objective of improving the performing. Such system will make them aware about three important points: The healthcare Treatment process progress, the eventual overflowing/ time excess, the eventual high acuity.

A ground-moving target continues to move on land and can not enter the sea. Similarly, a sea-moving target moves in the sea and the land serves as an infeasible region. Enforcing infeasible regions or hard constraints in the framework of the Kalman filter or interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator is not natural. However, these hard constraints can be easily enforced using the particle filter algorithm. We formulate the littoral tracking problem as a joint tracking and classification problem, where we assign a target class for each isolated land or water region. We use a reflecting boundary condition to enforce the region constraint. We demonstrate this concept for a single target using the airborne ground moving target indicator measurements. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm produces robust classification probabilities using kinematic measurements.","","0-9721844-1-4;0972184414","","10.1109/ICIF.2002.1020912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1020912","","Boundary conditions;Kinematics;Particle filters;Particle measurements;Particle tracking;Robustness;Sampling methods;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Target tracking","filtering theory;signal classification;target tracking","airborne ground moving target indicator measurements;ground-moving target;hard constraints;infeasible regions;joint tracking/classification problem;kinematic measurements;land;littoral tracking;particle filter algorithm;reflecting boundary condition;robust classification probabilities;sea-moving target;target class;target tracking","","8","","21","","","8-11 July 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the PPG, classification of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) is accomplished with a linear classifier. The two conventional parameters turbulence onset and slope are studied together with a recently introduced parameter characterizing turbulence shape. Performance is studied on a dataset with 4131 VPBs, recorded from a total of 27 patients in different clinical contexts (hemodialysis treatment, intensive care monitoring, and electrophysiological study). The sensitivity/specificity of VPB classification was found to be 90.5/99.9%, with an accuracy of 99.3%, suggesting that classification of VPBs can be reliable made from the PPG. The main difference between the two types of turbulence analysis stems from the fact that the pulse transit time varies largely immediately after the VPB. Out of the 22 patients which had a sufficient number of VPBs, the outcome of the ECG- and PPG-based analysis was identical in 21.

To achieve this, we have introduced the fake register insertion method and combined it with retiming method. Fake registers have been inserted on low-transition wires around high-transition wires to force the synthesis tool to direct those low-transition wires on LUTs' outputs. In other words, high-transition wires will be likely placed inside LUT blocks and consequently, the off-block switching activity among LUT blocks gets reduced. Retiming is used to move registers that have been located on high-transition wires in order to prevent the synthesis tool to place them on LUTs' outputs. As of benchmarking, two of ISCAS89 benchmark library circuits were employed. Experimental results have shown that this scheme will decrease the off-block switching of the implemented circuits up to 25%.","","978-1-4244-1544-1;9781424415441","978-1-4244-1545-8;9781424415458","10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4602495","","Circuit synthesis;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Optimization methods;Power dissipation;Registers;Switching circuits;Table lookup;Very large scale integration;Wires","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;table lookup","ISCAS89 benchmark library circuits;LUT based FPGA circuits;LUT blocks;fake register insertion method;high-transition wires;low-transition wires;off-block switching activity;power optimization;retiming method","","0","","11","","","22-24 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sampled-data nonlinear system is assumed to be controllable and its state vector is available for measurement. The variable structure control with a sector serves two purposes. One is to force the system state to be within the state region in which the NN's are used when the system goes out of neural control; and the other is to provide an additional control until the system tracking error metric is controlled inside the sector within the network approximation region. The proof of a complete stability and a tracking error convergence is given and the setting of the sector and the NN parameters is discussed. It is demonstrated that the asymptotic error of the system can be made dependent only on inherent network approximation errors and the frequency range of unmodeled dynamics.

Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE","20041101","2004","1","","","573","In the flue emission from internal combustion system using diffusing combustion such as coal or oil fuel boiler, incinerator or diesel engine, around 10% oxygen is usually included. It is difficult to reduce the NO<sub>X</sub> in the emission completely using catalysts or plasma alone because the part of NO<sub>X</sub> is oxidized under O<sub>2</sub> rich environment. In order to overcome these difficulties, we proposed a new after treatment system of NO<sub>X</sub> included in exhaust gas of combustion system using nonthermal plasma (NTP) desorption and reduction. In this system, exchangeable adsorbent columns are equipped. First, the exhaust gas including NO<sub>X</sub> is adsorbed to a NO<sub>X</sub> adsorbent for a period of ΔT<sub>a</sub>. After the period of ΔT<sub>a</sub> the path of exhaust gas is changed with a pair of rotary valves and NO<sub>X</sub> adsorbent is changed. The adsorbed NO<sub>X</sub> is desorbed from the adsorbent and reduced by applying NTP for a period of ΔT<sub>a</sub> using N<sub>2</sub> or low oxygen concentration gas. The exhaust gas is always kept clean by the exchange of adsorbent. Further, total electric energy can be reduced by taking ΔT<sub>d</sub>/ΔT<sub>a</sub> smaller because NTP is not applied for ΔT<sub>a</sub>. This system can be operated at atmospheric temperature because no catalyst is used. As an initial step to realize such kind of after treatment system, the basic characteristics of the N<sub>2</sub> NTP desorption and NO<sub>X</sub> reduction were examined experimentally using a pulse corona NTP reactor. After several adsorption/desorption processes, the amount of NO<sub>X</sub> adsorbed becomes equal to that of NO<sub>X</sub> desorbed, that is, all the NO<sub>X</sub> was desorbed in a single desorption process. It is confirmed that the NO<sub>X</sub> complete reduction using N<sub>2</sub> NTP desorption is possible not only for a simulated exhaust gas but for a real diesel engine gas. The effective or apparent SED can be decreased down to 29 Wh/m<sup>3</sup>. Further improvement will be obtained by decreasing the ratio of ΔT<sub>d</sub>/ΔT<sub>a</sub>.","0197-2618;01972618","0-7803-8486-5;0780384865","","10.1109/IAS.2004.1348462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348462","","Boilers;Combustion;Corona;Diesel engines;Fuels;Incineration;Inductors;Petroleum;Plasma temperature;Valves","air pollution;desorption;diffusion;flue gases;internal combustion engines;nitrogen;plasma applications","NO<sub>X</sub>;adsorption process;atmospheric temperature;catalysts;coal;desorption process;diesel engine;diffusing combustion;electric energy;exhaust gas;flue emission;incinerator;internal combustion system;nitrogen nonthermal plasma desorption;oil fuel boiler;pulse corona nonthermal plasma reactor;rotary valves","","1","","20","","","3-7 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a state-based approach to model software components as building blocks for flexible manufacturing control software. A general framework for modeling object-oriented manufacturing software is extended to component-oriented modeling. General approaches in developing state models, control logic, and interface components are presented. Software components that simulate sensors and control activities of the work cell were also created. The simulated components can interact with or replace real system components for planning, debugging, and testing purposes.

However it needs to be managed properly. This paper presents a study done on how technical education changed course in Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Orissa, a state on the east coast of India. The change was a reaction to the Information Technology boom in India combined with the modification of education policies by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which oversees the accreditation process of engineering colleges in India. The numerous engineering colleges and institutions that have mushroomed over the past five to seven years in the greater city of Bhubaneswar are proof to this. But the question is have they met the needs of the industry now? Does this new education system have the right ingredients for economic success? More importantly, can it be sustained long-term? This case study takes an exploratory approach to look at how engineering education has grown in Bhubaneswar and attempts to identify gaps in this specific instance which illustrates that technological education needs management.","2159-5100;21595100","978-1-890843-17-5;9781890843175","978-1-890843-18-2;9781890843182","10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599819","","Engineering education","educational institutions;engineering education;socio-economic effects","AICTE;All India Council for Technical Education;Bhubaneswar;India;Orissa;education policies;engineering colleges;engineering education;information technology;socio-economic development;technological education","","0","","17","","","27-31 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-mail: tjdevill@iafrica.com","2006 IEEE International Engineering Management Conference","20070730","2006","","","437","445","The purpose of IPTS is to unite the core project participants (those 20% of project participants responsible for 80% of the impact on the project success) with a common goal, so that they focus on what is in the interest of the project and not on their company's interest or local optimisation. Like a tripod, Integrated Project Team Strategies (IPTS) are supported on three legs that are referred to as its core principles. These principles are a common project incentive scheme, well-defined project success criteria and project control systems and procedures that focus on the project's needs and do not entice local optimisation. Because monetary reward is a short-term motivator for change in personal behaviour, it is a carrot under the donkey's nose for the project management team and the core project participants. As all the core project participants in IPTS now share in the same incentive scheme, their actions will be focussed on the same target because it determines the size of their bonuses / incentives. Project success criteria are their common target. It is therefore important that project success criteria are well defined for all three areas of success namely project management success, product success and relationship success. Traditional project control systems and metrics, which were used to measure the progress of the project, measure progress in isolation because they do not consider the overall need of the project. Local optimisation like tons steel erected per hour may occur because that is how managers on the project are assessed, however, that is not in the interest of the project. IPTS measurement systems focus on what is in the interest of the project and use performance drivers like critical chain and balanced scorecards differently to entice the required behaviour.","2159-3590;21593590","1-4244-0285-9;1424402859","1-4244-0286-7;1424402867","10.1109/IEMC.2006.4279905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4279905","","Africa;Control systems;Financial management;Incentive schemes;Leg;Nose;Pareto optimization;Project management;Resource management;Technology management","optimisation;project management","integrated project team strategies;local optimisation;project control systems;project incentive scheme;project management success;project success criteria","","0","","18","","","17-20 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Topical Conference on","20040824","2003","","","180","","Summary form only given. Recently, many spatial signal processing technologies based on plural antennas and signal processing has been studied. It is well known that the technologies, i.e., adaptive array, space division multiple access (SDMA), and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) provide increasing communication quality, spectrum efficiency, and throughput. However, the technologies are not yet almost utilized for the actual product. In order to introduce the spatial signal processing technologies to real commercial products, we have studied and developed them. We consider that a mobile terminal has a limitation of performance of a processor and power consumption. Therefore, we have studied the technologies that do not require heavy performance for a mobile terminal. In this paper, we present results of our research and development: the adaptive array PHS base station, SDMA PHS test bed, MIMO PHS test bed, and adaptive array WLAN test bed. We have carried out field tests for the AA PHS BS in Tokyo. The results of the field test show that the AA PHS BS increases the system traffic by about 11% and reduces interference level as compared with the existing PHS BS. Results of the field test for the SDMA PHS test bed indicate that the SDMA test bed improves the traffic by about 2.4 to 2.7 times, and can coexist with the existing PHS BS. Results of the indoor test for the MIMO PHS test bed indicate that the test bed establishes two stable paths if the MIMO BS antenna distance is larger than 1.0 λ and the MIMO terminal antenna distance is larger than 0.3 λ. We also have developed an adaptive array test bed for the wireless LAN, i.e., IEEE 802.11b. Results of the field test show that the AA-WLAN test bed expands communication distance by 1.9 times, and increases average throughput.","","0-7803-8196-3;0780381963","","10.1109/WCT.2003.1321478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1321478","","Adaptive arrays;Adaptive signal processing;Array signal processing;MIMO;Mobile antennas;Mobile communication;Multiaccess communication;Space technology;System testing;Throughput","IEEE standards;MIMO systems;adaptive antenna arrays;antenna testing;array signal processing;interference suppression;mobile antennas;mobile handsets;personal communication networks;space division multiple access;wireless LAN","AA PHS BS;IEEE 802.11b;MIMO system;PHS base station;PHS test bed;SDMA;Tokyo;WLAN test bed;adaptive array;interference reduction;mobile communication systems;mobile terminal;multi-input multi-output system;plural antennas;smart antenna;space division multiple access;spatial signal processing;system traffic","","0","","","","","15-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, appropriate mapping functions are derived to convert the actual nonlinear 2MM system into an equivalent reduced order system with rigid dynamics. This reduced order model is used as a target system to design a position controller, which is based on the standard proportional-integral-type control technique. Next, through I&I, the reduced order controller is applied to the nonlinear 2MM system to suppress the torsional vibrations and yield an overdamped response similar to the target system. The control law derivation and stability analysis of the target system are described and discussed. Simulations and experiments using a 2MM drive system are used to validate the proposed control methodology.

ARESOP is composed of knowledge generator (KG) based optimization mechanism and knowledge simulator (KS) based discrete event system and performance monitor based rule-based heuristic mechanism. The KG selects the optimal plan of control parameters based on the estimated behavior of the system and forecasting demand from legacy system like ERP and MRP. The KS evaluate the plan from KS and check whether it is acceptable. Feedback control loops are employed at higher level to evaluate the performance and update the control parameters. Also, The comparison between the optimal and actual values of the two monitoring variables: demand and production release rates is performed by Performance Monitor (PM) module. The times at which performance monitoring is done can be periodic (performance is sampled at regular time intervals, event-based (performance is sampled upon detection of certain event such as machine breakdown, urgent order arrivals)). The significant advantage of the proposed method is shown.

For this application it is essential to have a sensitive imaging technique suitable for polymeric CA. However, previously presented results have indicated difficulties in visualizing polymeric CA with commercially available contrast algorithms. Therefore a new subtraction algorithm (SA), was developed that define the difference between contrast and reference images. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response from a polymeric CA, when using the SA and compare it with existing contrast algorithms. Moreover, the possibility to detect a thin layer of CA was tested using the SA. Ultrasound short-axis images of a tissue-mimicking vessel phantom with a pulsating flow were obtained using a GE Vivid7 system (M12L) and a Philips iE33 system (S5-1). Repeated (n=91) contrast to tissue ratios (CTR) calculated at various mechanical index (MI) using the contrast algorithms pulse inversion (PI), power modulation (PM) and SA at a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> microbubbles/ml. The developed SA showed improvements in CTR compared to existing contrast algorithms. The CTRs were -0.99 dB ± 0.67 (MI 0.2), 9.46 dB ± 0.77 (MI 0.4) and 2.98 dB ± 0.60 (MI 0.8) with PI, 8.17 dB ± 1.15 (MI 0.2), 15.60 dB ± 1.29 (MI 0.4) and 11.60 dB ± 0.73 (MI 0.8) with PM and 14.97 dB ± 3.97 (MI 0.2), 20.89 dB ± 3.54 (MI 0.4) and 21.93 dB ± 4.37 (MI 0.8) with the SA.

A senior-level Algorithms course from the University of Washington was offered at Beihang University in Beijing, China through Tutored Video Instruction, whereby lectures recorded in class at the University of Washington were subsequently shown at Beihang and facilitated by local teaching assistants. In this mode of instruction, the Chinese teaching assistants conducted interactive classes using both the video materials and a classroom interaction system (Classroom Presenter) for electronically supported student activities.

Key to the success of any portable device is battery life (or runtime), and PAs can be a significant and detrimental load in this regard, especially because they capture a significant portion of the total power budget and they characteristically have poor power efficiencies. This course will address the advent of dynamically adaptive biasing schemes in PA applications to increase power efficiencies, which is generally done by essentially transforming and redefining the operating environment of the PA for maximum performance at optimum power levels, and consequently prolonging battery life.","","0-7803-9652-9;0780396529","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=EDP030","Antennas;Channel Capacity;MMSE;Mutual Information;Outage Layering;Receiver;Space-Time Block Code;Space-Time Channel;Space-Time Trellis Code;Suppression;Transmitter;Wireless communication;path gains","","","","","","","","","","3/15/2006","","IEEE","IEEE Courses"

Ad hoc routing protocols for WMNs are classified into: (a) proactive, (b) reactive, and (c) hybrid approaches. In general, proactive routing is more suitable for a stationary network, while reactive routing is better for a mobile network with a high mobility. In many applications, a node in WMN is mobile but it can fluctuate between being mobile and being stationary. Therefore, a hybrid routing approach with the ability to adapt to node mobility could improve the performance of WMNs. In this paper, we propose a Mobility-aware Hybrid Routing (MHR) approach for WMNs, which varies its routing between reactive and proactive to adapt to node mobility. The MHR basically uses a reactive approach for route discovery, and as a proactive approach it maintains the route entry in the routing table unless the route fails due to node movement, even if the route is not used. In this paper, the MHR approach was applied to AODV, and herein called AODV-MHR. Its performance was compared with that of AODV and OLSR by simulation. The simulation results showed that AODVMHR could achieve the advantages of both reactive and proactive routing approaches in performance.","","978-1-4244-7508-7;9781424475087","","10.1109/MESH.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5632079","Reactive routing;ad hoc routing;hybrid routing;proactive routing;wireless mesh networks","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","AODV-MHR;WMN node;ad hoc routing protocols;mobile network;mobility-aware hybrid routing approach;node mobility;proactive routing approach;reactive routing;stationary network;wireless mesh networks","","1","","14","","","18-25 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm takes the object detection problem as two classes classification, thus it can take the advantages of the Fuzzy SVM. The algorithm takes template matching as the coarse filter, which can reduce the amount of data and getting rid of redundancy of the data sets. Template matching can also diminish the difficulty of SVM training, and speed up the training progress. Moreover, the Normalized correlation coefficients are computed in the stage of template matching. These coefficients are used to determine the fuzzy membership without any additional computation. The experiments show that the algorithms have low error rate and high speed.","","0-7803-8273-0;0780382730","","10.1109/WCICA.2004.1342286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1342286","","Computer science;Error analysis;Learning systems;Machine learning;Matched filters;Object detection;Redundancy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","filtering theory;fuzzy set theory;object detection;pattern classification;pattern matching;support vector machines","coarse filter;data set redundancy;fuzzy membership;fuzzy support vector machine;learning machine;normalized correlation coefficients;object detection;template matching;training algorithm;two layer serial classifier","","1","","","","","15-19 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By combining adaptive-backstepping technique and DSC technique, an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback backstepping-control approach is developed. The proposed control method not only overcomes the problem of “explosion of complexity” inherent in the backstepping-design methods but also overcomes the problem of unavailable state measurements. It is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop adaptive-control system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin.

Each linear method uses a different objective function to recover underlying source components by exploiting statistical structure across a large number of sensors. We test these methods using a dual-task event-related paradigm. While engaged in a primary task, subjects must detect infrequent changes in the visual display, which would be expected to evoke several well-known event-related potentials (ERPs), including the N2 and P3. We find that though each method utilizes a different objective function, they in fact yield similar components. We note that one advantage of the LD approach is that the recovered component is easily interpretable, namely it represents the component within a given time window which is most discriminating for the task, given a spatial integration of the sensors. Both ICA and CSP return multiple components, of which the most discriminating component may not be the first. Thus, for these methods, visual inspection or additional processing is required to determine the significance of these components for the task.","","0-7803-8388-5;0780383885","","10.1109/ISBI.2004.1398712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1398712","","Biomedical engineering;Data acquisition;Displays;Electroencephalography;Enterprise resource planning;Image resolution;Independent component analysis;Inspection;Spatial resolution;Testing","electroencephalography;independent component analysis;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;visual evoked potentials","common spatial patterns;event-related potentials;high spatial density electroencephalography;independent component analysis;linear discrimination;recovering task-relevant neural activity;supervised linear methods;unsupervised linear methods","","0","","8","","","15-18 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The original R, G, and B are transformed to H (hue), S (saturation), and V (value) domain, as well as to Y, I, and Q for the NTSC system. With the help of morphological image processing, the fusion of S, V, Y, I and Q segmentations are used for full-body detection, while the individual V, I and Q segmentations are used for body-parts detection. An adaptive thresholding scheme has been developed for dealing with body size changes, illumination condition changes, and cross camera parameter changes. Preliminary tests with the PETS 2014 datasets show that we can obtain high probability of detection (Pd=100%) and low probability of false alarm (Pfa=1.95%) for both full-body and body-parts. The reliable body-parts (e.g. head) detection allows us to continuously track the individual person even though the torsos and legs of several closely spaced persons are merged together, and accurate human head localization is critical for human ID (face recognition). Furthermore, the detected body-parts allow us to extract important local constellation features of the body-parts' positions and angles related to the centroid position of the full-body. These features are critical for human walk gating estimation (a biometric feature for walking pattern recognition), as well as for human pose (e.g. standing or falling down) estimation for potential abnormal behavior and accidental event detection.","","","","10.1109/AVSS.2014.6918695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918695","","Cameras;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Legged locomotion;Target tracking","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image segmentation;object detection;object tracking","HSV domain;NTSC system;PETS 2014 datasets;RGB domain;SVYIQ segmentations;YIQ domain;accidental event detection;adaptive thresholding scheme;body size changes;body-part detection;body-part tracking;color patch segmentation;cross camera parameter changes;face recognition;high probability of detection;human ID;human full-body detection;human full-body tracking;human head localization;human pose estimation;human walk gating estimation;illumination condition changes;intensity patch segmentation;local constellation feature extraction;low probability of false alarm;morphological image processing;potential abnormal behavior","","1","","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Starting from historical sales data on new computers and assuming a plausible first life span distribution of desktop and laptop computers, the historical penetration rate is expressed in terms of the number of computers owned per capita. We then work to extrapolate the current trend to the future by using a logistic model, an S-shaped curve based on a rate constant and a carrying capacity, the latter expressing the asymptotic limit of adoption of the technology. The major challenge met is that the personal computer is still in an early stage of adoption from a technology life cycle perspective. It is thus still too early for statistical fits to yield a reasonable estimation of carrying capacity. Our approach is to use a bounding analysis, the guiding principle of which is characterization of a range of possibility as opposed to a best guess value. We determine plausible upper and lower bounds on the future carrying capacity to be 1.3 and 0.71 computers per capita respectively. Under our assumptions for computer lifetime, these bounds correspond to an equilibrium generation of 132 million obsolete computers as an upper bound and 76 million as a lower bound. Evolution towards these bounds is estimated using the logistic model. One result of the analysis is the generation of obsolete computers by 2020 will be at most 20% away from the long-term carrying capacity. At the lower bound of adoption, generation of obsolete computers will plateau in 2021 and in 2047 for the upper bound.","1095-2020;10952020","978-1-4244-2272-2;9781424422722","978-1-4244-2298-2;9781424422982","10.1109/ISEE.2008.4562905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4562905","Computer penetration rate;bounding analysis;e-waste;end-of-life computers;logistic model","Character generation;Context modeling;Distributed computing;Economic forecasting;Electronic waste;Home appliances;Logistics;Marketing and sales;Mathematical model;Personal communication networks","computers;economic forecasting;electronic products;waste management","S-shaped curve;bounding analysis;desktop computers;equilibrium generation;laptop computers;obsolete computers;rate constant;replacement computer;user purchasing;waste management","","0","","24","","","19-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Exploiting the Incomplete Diffusion Feature: A Specialized Analytical Side-Channel Attack Against the AES and Its Application to Microcontroller Implementations","S. Guo; X. Zhao; F. Zhang; T.

Ma",", Institute of North Electronic Equipment, Beijing, China","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","20140508","2014","9","6","999","1014","Algebraic side-channel attack (ASCA) is a typical technique that relies on a general solver to solve the equations of a cipher and its side-channel leaks. It falls under analytical side-channel attack and can recover the entire key at once. Many ASCAs are proposed against the AES, and they utilize the Gröbner basis-based, SAT-based, or optimizer-based solver. The advantage of the general solver approach is its generic feature, which can be easily applied to different cryptographic algorithms. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to take into account the specialized properties of the targeted cryptographic algorithms. The results vary depending on what type of solver is used, and the time complexity is quite high when considering the error-tolerant attack scenarios. Thus, we were motivated to find a new approach that would lessen the influence of the general solver and reduce the time complexity of ASCA. This paper proposes a new analytical side-channel attack on AES by exploiting the incomplete diffusion feature in one AES round. We named our technique incomplete diffusion analytical side-channel analysis (IDASCA). Different from previous ASCAs, IDASCA adopts a specialized approach to recover the secret key of AES instead of the general solver. Extensive attacks are performed against the software implementation of AES on an 8-bit microcontroller. Experimental results show that: 1) IDASCA can exploit the side-channel leaks in all AES rounds using a single power trace; 2) it has less time complexity and more robustness than previous ASCAs, especially when considering the error-tolerant attack scenarios; and 3) it can calculate the reduced key search space of AES for the given amount of side-channel leaks. IDASCA can also interpret the mechanism behind previous ASCAs on AES from a quantitative perspective, such as why ASCA can work under unknown plaintext/ciphertext scenarios and what are the extreme cases in ASCAs.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2315534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6782659","AES;Hamming weight leakage model;Incomplete diffusion;algebraic side-channel attack;microcontrollers","Ciphers;Electronic mail;Equations;Mathematical model;Microcontrollers;Software","computability;computational complexity;cryptography;microcontrollers","AES;Gröbner basis-based solver;IDASCA;SAT-based solver;algebraic side-channel attack;cryptographic algorithms;error-tolerant attack scenarios;general solver approach;incomplete diffusion analytical side-channel analysis;incomplete diffusion feature;microcontroller implementations;optimizer-based solver;plaintext-ciphertext scenario;side-channel leaks;single power trace;specialized analytical side-channel attack;time complexity","","1","","37","","2014-04-03","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A novel solution called total frequency hopping (TFH) is presented in order to overcome the frequency allocation and the inter-HBS synchronisation problems. The HBS system will use the same frequency band as the overlaying GSM network and thus creates more interference to it. The simulation results reveal that the negative impact of the underlying HBS system on the GSM network performance is minimal provided that the HBS transmission (TX) power is reasonable low.

As many such systems depend on cheap microcontrollers, a common approach to networking has been based on the combination of the available standard serial communication controller (UART) normally included in such devices and RS-485 drivers. However UART-based network protocols do have some potential disadvantages. Controller area network (CAN) offers an attractive alternative due to the availability and low cost of CAN based devices. This paper compares these two approaches in the design of a serial bus, devoted to internal interconnection in a commercial range of modular power backup systems, and describes the migration process from the first to the second solution.","","0-7803-7474-6;0780374746","","10.1109/IECON.2002.1185345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185345","","Communication standards;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed control;Electrical equipment industry;Machine tools;Machinery production industries;Medical control systems;Microcontrollers;Power generation","computer interfaces;controller area networks;data communication equipment;distributed control;emergency power supply;microcontrollers","CAN;RS-485;UART;UART-based network protocols;backup power plants;controller area network;distributed control;industrial products;internal interconnection;machine tool;medical devices;microcontrollers;modular power backup systems;modular power plants;serial bus;serial buses;serial communication controller;vending machines","","2","15","20","","","5-8 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed a nursing-care robot, RIBA, which can perform transfer tasks using its two arms. RIBA must lift the appropriate part of the care receiver's body and transfer the care receiver between the bed and the wheelchair without inflicting pain or discomfort. To accomplish this, RIBA must know the care receiver's position in its arms when the arms are between the bed and the care receiver. To detect the points of contact between the care receiver and the robotic arms, the position of the care receiver on the robotic arms was estimated by using tactile sensors on the robotic arms as well as a machine learning algorithm. The results show that the caregiver position was estimated with 97% accuracy by our method.","1930-0395;19300395","","","10.1109/ICSENS.2013.6688439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688439","","Manipulators;Mobile robots;Position measurement;Receivers;Tactile sensors","dexterous manipulators;injuries;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;patient care;tactile sensors;wheelchairs","RIBA;bed;care receiver position estimation;machine learning algorithm;nursing care robot;patient transfer task;point of contact detection;robot dual arm;strain injury;tactile sensor;wheelchair","","1","","5","","","3-6 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We treat this as a deconvolution problem for which the goal is to minimize the cost function corresponding to the maximum likelihood estimate of the restored image. Our approach uses an iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithm. This method handles nonparametric phase errors and removes distortions exactly. We present results on real SAR data and demonstrate that quality is limited only by measurement noise.

The Cassini Mission is planned for launch to the environment of Saturn in 1997. Designated Hughes 955H, the TWT has demonstrated an overall saturated efficiency in excess of 40 percent. To achieve this performance, several LeRC-developed technologies, including computer-aided advanced designs of the helix and the multistage depressed collector (MDC), along with suppression of secondary electron emission from the MDC electrodes, were used in the TWT design. An engineering model TWT and two flight model TWT's have been fabricated, packaged, and performance-tested for delivery to JPL. The production of flight hardware as a part of a program which originally was intended as a research effort has resulted in reduced overall costs and a shortened delivery schedule.

At room temperature, the noise power spectra have a classic 1/f dependence with a Hooge parameter that is ~ 5 times 10<sup>-3</sup>.

We find that the PBG's in the MPC's strongly depend on physical and geometric parameters in the structures, such as the shapes of the 2D lattice and the scatterers, the permeability of the scatterers, and so on. Therefore, the introduction of magnetic material into the PC's may diversify the favorable candidates of the PC's in nature.

Analytic calculation for CT simulation has been also evaluated in recent years. Due to ignoring basic physical processes, analytic methods have limited applications. In this study, a hardware mimicking algorithm has been developed to accurately model the CT imaging chain using analytic calculation. The model includes x-ray spectrum generation according to the pre-defined scanning protocol. The detector is designed to acquire the data either in integral or spectral modes. CT geometry can be used as parallel or fan beam with different sizes. Poisson noise model was applied to the acquired projection data. Varieties of projection-based computerized phantoms have been designed and implemented in the simulator. CT number and background noise of the simulated images have been compared with experimental data. On average, the relative difference between simulated and experimental HUs are 8.3%, 7.5%, and 8.0% for bone; 12.1%, 10.3%, and 7.8% for contrast agent; and 16.6%, 3.6%, and 5.2% for the background at 80 kVp/500 mAs, 120 kVp/250 mAs, and 140 kVp/125 mAs, respectively. The relative difference between simulated and experimental noise values vary between 2% to slightly less than 26%. For scanning and image generation with a computer equipped with Intel Core2 Quad CPU and 2.0 GB of RAM, the simulator takes about 32 seconds for generating a 512×512 single slice image when it is adjusted to acquire 900 projection angles with 20 mm slice thickness and 140kVp/200 mAs scanning protocol. The simulation time is independent of photon intensity.","1082-3654;10823654","978-1-4799-0533-1;9781479905331","","10.1109/NSSMIC.2013.6829157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829157","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computed tomography;Detectors;Noise;Phantoms;X-ray imaging","Monte Carlo methods;computerised tomography;phantoms","Monte Carlo technique;Poisson noise model;X-ray computed tomography;X-ray spectrum generation;analytic calculation;contrast agent;hardware mimicking analytic CT simulator;photon intensity;projection based computerized phantoms;scanning protocol","","0","","6","","","Oct. 27 2013-Nov. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The energy gap between two quantum states increases linearly with the applied external magnetic field strength. The electron spin resonance (ESR) peaks at the moment that the microwave wave photo energy is exactly equal to the electron energy gap. Previous researches demonstrated spatially resolved electron spin resonances using evanescent microwave magnetic-dipole probe at 3.7 GHz on the ruby surface. The minimum number of detected electron spin centers was in the range of 20,000 to 30,000. This paper is to present a new ESR detection technique by integrating the atomic force microscopy (AFM) with near field microwave probe. With smaller probe tips, the spatially confined magnetic field is expected to increase the sensitivity of ESR detections. Both AFM and near field microwave probe techniques are non-destructive and non-invasive measurement techniques. Thus, the new technique will be a powerful instrument for many applications that include the detection of material defect pockets, detecting free radicals in biological tissues, and the analysis of structure and dynamics of biomembranes. Our ultimate objective is to spatially detect single electron spin center and use the single electron as one quantum bit in future spintronic devices.","1944-9399;19449399","978-1-4244-0607-4;9781424406074","978-1-4244-0608-1;9781424406081","10.1109/NANO.2007.4601224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601224","Electron spin resonance;atomic force microscopy;biomedical magnetic;microwave spectroscopy;paramagnetic resonance;resonance imaging","Atomic force microscopy;Electrons;Energy resolution;Magnetic fields;Magnetic resonance imaging;Microwave imaging;Microwave theory and techniques;Paramagnetic resonance;Probes;Spatial resolution","EPR imaging;atomic force microscopy;energy gap;magnetoelectronics","AFM;atomic force microscopy;biological tissues;biomembranes;electron energy gap;electron spin centers;electron spin resonance imaging;frequency 3.7 GHz;microwave magnetic-dipole probe;microwave wave photo energy;near field microwave probe;nondestructive measurement;noninvasive measurement;quantum states;spintronic devices","","1","","12","","","2-5 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of alternative energy sources also requires ULV operation in some applications. Achieving sufficient linearity with low power consumption is very challenging for the ULV mixer and baseband circuits. The on-chip LO generation and distribution is difficult due to the low-voltage device bias. We present optimized mixer and filter topologies, and a polyphase LO buffer, used in a low-power ULV receiver for 2.4GHz applications like Bluetooth or Zigbee.

Higher preclean bias power and shorter preclean time demonstrate remarkable low via resistance and excellent Cu-reliability performance. In addition, the via-diameter effect to Cu stressmigration is explored. A superior Cu precleaning process condition is developed to improve Cu stress-induced voiding and EM. The preclean bias power of argon plasma should be kept as high as possible but not too high to avoid damaging underlying metal, while the resputtering clean time should keep as short as possible but sufficiently long in order to clean via bottoms.

In addition, the influence of a one-step delay in the digital implementation is investigated and this is compensated for using a predictive scheme. The main advantages of the proposed strategy are that there is no need to use a switching table for voltage vector positioning, the power ripple is reduced, and the system displays excellent steady-state and dynamic performance.

Most reported noise filters can only reduce impulse noise or Gaussian noise but it is not effective for filtering real video captured by CCD-based camera. Those filters usually have a fatal drawback: they cause object-overlapped or object-blurred phenomenon in an image frame while an object is moving. To overcome such problems, the proposed strategy is that a frame will be divided into stationary and moving regions and then the appropriate filtering techniques for each region are employed. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can provide a filtering speed of at least 36% over other filters, in addition, it still gives a higher visual quality while keeping a moderate compressing ratio.","","978-0-7695-2994-1;9780769529941","","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457761","","1f noise;Cameras;Colored noise;Filtering;Filters;Gaussian noise;Noise reduction;Phase noise;Video compression;Working environment noise","Gaussian noise;filtering theory;impulse noise;video signal processing","CCD-based camera;Gaussian noise;impulse noise;object-based temporal filtering;object-blurred phenomenon;object-overlapped phenomenon;video noise reduction","","0","1","12","","","26-28 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approximate value function is the pointwise supremum of a family of lower bounds on the value function of the stochastic control problem; evaluating the control policy involves the solution of a min-max or saddle-point problem. For a quadratically constrained linear quadratic control problem, evaluating the policy amounts to solving a semidefinite program at each time step. By evaluating the policy, we obtain a lower bound on the value function, which can be used to evaluate performance: When the lower bound and the achieved performance of the policy are close, we can conclude that the policy is nearly optimal. We describe several numerical examples where this is indeed the case.","2165-3011;21653011","978-1-4577-1066-7;9781457710667","978-1-4577-1067-4;9781457710674","10.1109/CACSD.2011.6044538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6044538","","Approximation methods;Dynamic programming;Investments;Minimization;Monte Carlo methods;Noise;Optimization","approximation theory;discrete time systems;dynamic programming;minimax techniques;stochastic systems","discrete-time dynamical system;linear quadratic control problem;min max approximate dynamic programming;saddle point problem;stochastic control problem","","2","","23","","","28-30 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to limited resources at sensor nodes such schemes cannot be based on post deployment computations. Instead, pairwise (symmetric) keys are required to be pre-distributed by assigning a list of keys, (a.k.a. key-chain), to each sensor node. If a pair of nodes does not have a common key after deployment then they must find a key-path with secured links. The objective is to minimize the keychain size while (i) maximizing pairwise key sharing probability and resilience, and (ii) minimizing average key-path length. This paper presents a deterministic key distribution scheme based on Expander Graphs. It shows how to map the parameters (e.g., degree, expansion, and diameter) of a Ramanujan Expander Graph to the desired properties of a key distribution scheme for a physical network topology.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","10.1109/ICC.2006.255107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024502","","Computer science;Graph theory;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network topology;Raman scattering;Resilience;Wireless sensor networks","","","","2","","22","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trying to make these an automatic process is fundamental for the volcanological community. It is crucial to choose how the seismic signal is represented in terms of parameters or features useful for dealing with the automatic classification problem, since the number and type of parameters could be really large leading to the curse of dimensionality issue. Machine learning theory establishes that in order to build a classifier from a labeled database, there should be a compromise between the complexity of the classifier and the size of the database. Since generating a manually labeled database is a tedious work performed by specialists in volcanology, the size of the databases limits the complexity of the classification systems built by them. On the other hand, if the databases could be represented by a reduced, but relevant, number of features, the complexity of the classifier would be simplified. In order to study the problem just described, this paper performs a comparative study of different classical techniques of dimensionality reduction (DR) of the feature set. The algorithms implemented include feature selection techniques as wrappers and filters and methods which directly transform the original feature space into another with lower dimension. All algorithms have been tested using an automatic classification system of volcano-seismic events. The best results have been obtained with the discriminative feature selection (DFS) algorithm which belongs to the set of wrapper methods.","1939-1404;19391404","","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2479300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7305750","Dimensionality reduction (DR);discriminative feature selection (DFS);feature selection algorithms;feature space transformation;probabilistic models;volcano-seismic classification","Databases;Earthquakes;Feature extraction;Frequency-domain analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Transforms;Volcanoes","feature selection;geophysical signal processing;seismology;signal classification;volcanology","automatic classification system;classifier complexity;dimensionality reduction algorithm;discriminative feature selection algorithm;machine learning theory;seismic event classification;seismic event detection;volcano-seismic event;volcano-seismic signal;volcanology;wrapper method","","","","22","","2015-10-26","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These parameters come with error because of attenuation, atmospheric absorption and other external factors. All the factors indeed lead towards the inaccurate location estimation. This research work is a continuation of our previous research in which we proposed ERT (Error Rate Table) for precise location estimation of mobile nodes. Proposed architecture was built by considering the attenuation in clutters/terrains. Thirteen clutters were proposed by considering the attenuation of the field. ERT was constructed based on the data points collected at 10 meter distance in each clutter and with the three zone divisions. Current research is focusing to reduce the errors of ERT. We collect data points in each clutter at every 2m instead of 10m. Prototype is built by using WiFi (IEEE 802.11b/g standard) and a C sharp program is used to calculate data points in each clutter/terrain. Clutter based Enhance Error Rate Table (CERT) is proposed by dividing the data points in eight zones for precise location estimation. Data collected from Agriculture/Field (A/F) clutter is considered as a baseline data because of its low error rate. CERT helps to minimize errors from 3m-18.5m (ERT correction) range to 2.5m-10m (CERT correction) range based on the clutter we are dealing with.","","978-1-61284-485-5;9781612844855","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6014039","atteunation;clutter/terrain;error rate table;location estimation","Absorption;Clutter;Diffraction;GSM;High definition video;Rain;Reflection","clutter;error correction;mobile radio;telecommunication standards;wireless LAN","C sharp program;CERT;IEEE 802.11b/g standard;WiFi;agriculture/field clutter;attenuation;available signal strength;clutter based enhance error rate table;clutters/terrains;data points;error correction;location estimation;mobile nodes;receive signal strength","","0","","7","","","27-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regarding the safety, the dependability theory sets the behavioral requirements for a system in case of fault but does not deal with the characteristics of the systems used to achieve the requirements. This gap is filled up by the standards on the functional safety, which are introduced in the second part of the paper together with the concepts of risk, safety function and safety integrity level.

Usually, BPF is inferior to FBP in terms of reconstruction quality. There are two main causes. First, BPF has to use a 2-dimensional discrete ramp filter formed by sampling the continuous ramp filter, resulting in DC shift and aliasing artefacts. Second, the common ramp filter amplifies high frequency noise much. To address such two issues, a weighted ramp filter is investigated to reduce the amplification of high frequency noise, and then a total-variation based backprojection regularization (BPR) method is developed to mitigate the DC shift and improve the robustness to noise. The experimental results show that BPR outperforms FBP for low-dose CT imaging reconstruction.","1094-687X;1094687X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320013","","Approximation algorithms;Band-pass filters;Business process re-engineering;Computed tomography;Fourier transforms;Image reconstruction","computerised tomography;dosimetry;filtering theory;image reconstruction;image sampling;medical image processing","2-dimensional discrete ramp filter;BPF;DC shift;FBP;aliasing artefacts;backprojection regularization;high frequency noise;image sampling;low-dose CT imaging reconstruction;tomographic reconstruction;weighted ramp filter","","","","11","","","25-29 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It Is known that thermally constricted arcs in molecular gases generate unstable anodic arc roots in the nozzle of the torch. Moreover, using a usual plasma spray torch at reduced electrical power level in an argon-hydrogen gas mixture at a pressure of about 120 mbar, the arc is strongly influenced by hydrodynamic forces. Especially, its long time behavior shown by the arc voltage course is very variable and nonreproducible. It is the purpose of this work to optimize the nozzle geometry and the gas flow rate in order to obtain stabilized operating conditions of the plasma torch for an arc current of 100 A. It will be shown that the design of the entrance region and the diameter of the anodic nozzle influence the are column motion as well as the level and the frequency of the voltage fluctuations. With a particularly modified anodic nozzle, stable and reproducible operating conditions of the plasma torch, which is used to synthesize diamond layers, will be obtained","0093-3813;00933813","","","10.1109/27.649583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=649583","","Design optimization;Fluctuations;Fluid flow;Frequency;Gases;Geometry;Hydrodynamics;Plasma stability;Thermal spraying;Voltage","plasma arc spraying;plasma torches","100 A;Ar-H<sub>2</sub>;Ar-H<sub>2</sub> gas mixture;anodic arc attachment fluctuations;anodic nozzle;anodic nozzle influence;arc current;arc voltage;column motion;diamond layers;gas flow rate;hydrodynamic forces;low electric power levels;molecular gases;nozzle geometry;operating conditions;plasma spray torch;plasma torch;thermally constricted arcs;torch nozzle;unstable anodic arc roots;voltage fluctuations","","1","","14","","","Oct 1997","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By combining neural networks based controllers with a linear robust adaptive controller, in a multiple models, switching and tuning (MMST) framework, some recent results have established boundedness of signals when such neural networks are used for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems. It was required that a neural network ""certainty equivalence"" controller should generate a control input that renders the output of the chosen model identical to the desired output for the plant. This is not a trivial task when the model is non-affine in the current control input variable, and in such a case iterative optimization routines have to be resorted to. This paper examines the issues involved in determining such an input, relaxes some of the conditions, and proposes an improved scheme in which neural network controllers can be used while assuring boundedness of signals.","0743-1619;07431619","0-7803-7896-2;0780378962","","10.1109/ACC.2003.1240502","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240502","","Adaptive control;Control systems;Current control;Input variables;Neural networks;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear systems;Robust control;Signal processing;Stability","adaptive control;discrete time systems;identification;iterative methods;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;optimisation;robust control","certainty equivalence controller;certainty equivalence neural network controller;control input variable;discrete-time nonlinear system;iterative optimization routine;linear robust adaptive controller;multiple models switching framework;multiple models tuning framework;nonlinear adaptive control;signal boundedness","","0","","14","","","4-6 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the following performance parameters are obtained and clarified as functions for the diode-on duty-cycle and for !CR: the initial phase angle of the input voltage, the voltage and current transfer functions, the normalized input resistance and capacitance, the normalized diode current stress, and the power-output capability. In addition, the circuit design is provided and a method for calculating the power-conversion efficiency is described.

These changes are especially large in harsh environments, where the effects of aging on solder joint behavior must be accounted for and included in constitutive models when predicting reliability. In our prior work, the Anand viscoplastic model has been used to establish theoretical equations for the uniaxial stress-strain response (constant strain rate) and creep response of lead-free solders. Procedures were also developed for extracting the Anand model constants from experimental stress-strain or creep data. A revised Anand constitutive model for lead free solder material that includes aging effects was also investigated. In that work, the evolutions of the Anand parameters with aging were found using stress-strain testing. In this study, we have extended our prior work to investigate aging effects on the creep curves of lead free solder materials, and to use the observed changes to determine the evolution of the Anand model parameters with aging using the creep test procedure. In particular, Anand parameters for SAC305 (Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu) lead free solder were found from aging dependent creep test data for samples subjected to prior aging at 100 C for various time durations (0-6 months). For each set of aging conditions, creep data were measured at several stress levels (σ = 6, 8, 10, 12 and 15 MPa) and several testing temperatures (T = 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 C). Mathematical expressions were also developed to model the evolution of the Anand model parameter with aging time. Our findings show that 2 of the 9 Anand parameters remain essentially constant during aging, while the other 7 show large changes (30-70%) with up to 6 months of aging at 100 C. The results also show that the changes are rapid during first 20 days of aging. After - hat, they change slowly and linearly for longer aging times. The determined variation of Anand parameters from the creep test method was also compared with our prior results obtained from using stressstrain test data, and good agreement was found between the results of the two methods. Finally, the creep curves for different aging times have been predicted using the different sets of Anand parameters that are appropriate for those aging times. Good correlation was observed between the experimental curves and the model predictions.","1087-9870;10879870","","","10.1109/ITHERM.2014.6892273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892273","Aging;Anand Model;Constitutive Relations;Creep Test;Lead Free Solder","Aging;Creep;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Equations;Mathematical model;Strain;Stress","copper alloys;creep testing;curve fitting;silver alloys;solders;strain ageing;stress-strain relations;tin alloys;viscoplasticity","Anand constitutive model;Anand model constants;Anand model parameters;Anand parameters;Anand viscoplastic model;SnAgCu;aging effects;constant strain rate;creep curves;creep data;creep response;creep test method;creep test procedure;isothermal aging;lead free solder material;microstructural characterization;solder joint behavior;stress-strain data;stress-strain testing;temperature 100 C;temperature 125 C;temperature 25 C;temperature 50 C;temperature 75 C;thermal cycling;time 0 month to 6 month;uniaxial stress-strain response","","1","","37","","","27-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, given the difficulties and uncertainty in both technological and social aspects, such transition will most probably be happening gradually, step by step. Here with a computational case study based on the city of Atlanta within the Upper Chattahoochee watershed in the southeastern United States, we simulated three steps of transition, i.e. 50%, 70%, and 100% ANS-separation (Anthropogenic Nutrient Solution) is reached. The economic sustainability of these transition strategies was evaluated with total annual economic cost (TAEC), and the environmental sustainability was evaluated with three indicators, i.e. ecological footprints (EF), flux of materials passing through the city in its context of global material cycles, and pulse rate in terms of the spectrum of disturbance frequency to which the city is subject. The simulation results showed that compared with the current strategy, the ANS-separation has significantly lower TAEC, lower EF, lower pollutant discharge, higher recovery of nutrient and energy, and more beneficial manipulation of perturbation regimes of the city's environment. These advantages increase with the rate of ANS-separation.","1062-922X;1062922X","978-1-4244-2793-2;9781424427932","978-1-4244-2794-9;9781424427949","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346301","ANS-separation;Ecological footprint;Total annual economic cost;metabolism;pulse rate;sustainable city","Biological system modeling;Cities and towns;Computational modeling;Costs;Economic indicators;Environmental economics;Green products;Power generation economics;Uncertainty;Wastewater treatment","socio-economic effects;sustainable development;wastewater treatment","Atlanta;anthropogenic nutrient solution;ecological footprints;economic sustainability;environmental sustainability;incremental infrastructure transitions;source-separation;total annual economic cost;upper Chattahoochee watershed;wastewater treatment","","2","","36","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The offset must be repeatable as one cycles the temperature of the device. A variance in offset after a temperature cycle is defined as thermal hysteresis. This phenomenon is non-linear and is extremely difficult to compensate for with an ASIC. This paper discusses the methodology used to analyze, model, and correct a prototype accelerometer design that had significant thermal hysteresis. It steps through the experiments which demonstrate that the major cause of the hysteresis was an aluminum thin film on the transducer die, the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) modeling used to simulate this phenomenon and the final experimental data. The final solution for this transducer was to decrease the metal thickness by 50%, which reduced the magnitude of the hysteresis to a level that would allow the product to operate within the specifications of 2.25 V to 2.75 V (with a 5.0 V power supply) with an acceptable process capability.","","0-7803-8133-5;0780381335","","10.1109/ICSENS.2003.1279142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1279142","","Accelerometers;Aluminum;Analytical models;Application specific integrated circuits;Finite element methods;Hysteresis;Prototypes;Temperature;Transducers;Transistors","accelerometers;finite element analysis;micromachining;micromechanical devices","2.25 to 2.75 V;5.0 V;ASIC;Al thin film;acceptable process capability;finite element analysis;micromachined accelerometers;offset;prototype accelerometer design;static g-field;thermal hysteresis;transducer device;transducer die","","1","","2","","","22-24 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed FINE framework employs a ciphertext-policy anonymous attribute-based encryption technique to achieve fine-grained access control, location privacy, confidentiality of the LBS data and its access policy, and accurate LBS query result while without involving any trusted third party. Moreover, the proposed FINE framework also integrates the transformation key and proxy re-encryption to migrate most of computation-intensive tasks from the LBS provider and users to the cloud server. This property keeps mobile devices away from massive resource-consuming operations. Extensive analysis shows that our proposed FINE framework is secure and highly efficient for mobile devices in terms of computation and communication cost.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847945","","Access control;Encryption;Mobile handsets;Mobile radio mobility management;Servers","authorisation;cryptography;mobile computing","DaaS model;FINE framework;LBS data;LBS framework;ciphertext-policy anonymous attribute-based encryption technique;data-as-a-service model;fine-grained access control;fine-grained privacy-preserving location-based service framework;location privacy;mobile devices","","5","","24","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally speaking, the employee engagement increases with age, education level, work position, length of service and salary. However, the senior managers with higher education and the staff whose length of service is 11 to 15 years appear unusual decline in engagement. The performances of the groups with different level of employee engagement are significantly different, i.e., the higher the employee engagement, the better the performance.

Recent advancements have given rise to robots that are able to interpret natural language manipulation and navigation commands, but these methods require a prior map of the robot's environment. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that enables robots to successfully follow natural language route directions without any previous knowledge of the environment. The algorithm utilizes spatial and semantic information that the human conveys through the command to learn a distribution over the metric and semantic properties of spatially extended environments. Our method uses this distribution in place of the latent world model and interprets the natural language instruction as a distribution over the intended behavior. A novel belief space planner reasons directly over the map and behavior distributions to solve for a policy using imitation learning. We evaluate our framework on a voice-commandable wheelchair. The results demonstrate that by learning and performing inference over a latent environment model, the algorithm is able to successfully follow natural language route directions within novel, extended environments.","1050-4729;10504729","","","10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139984","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139984","","Grounding;Natural languages;Robot sensing systems;Semantics;Topology","handicapped aids;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;natural language processing;path planning;speech-based user interfaces;wheelchairs","behavior distribution;belief space planner;latent world model;learning models;map distribution;natural language manipulation interpretation;natural language navigation command interpretation;natural language route directions;semantic information utilization;spatial information utilization;unknown environments;voice-commandable wheelchair","","1","","23","","","26-30 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Essentially the algorithm simulates the propagation of sound within an environment using reflected beams whose shape is governed by the shape of reflecting surfaces. Hence the adaptive beam tracing avoids spurious and missing reflections or large computation times associated with other methods whilst providing the prediction of both specular and diffuse sound propagation. The current implementation uses the new managed DirectX API for simulating visually and aurally virtual environments and explores possibility of real time acoustic rendering using predicted acoustics in conjunction with the 3D rendering classes offered by managed DirectX.","1550-6037;15506037","0-7695-2397-8;0769523978","","10.1109/IV.2005.121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509188","","Acoustic beams;Acoustic propagation;Acoustic reflection;Computational modeling;Environmental management;Optical reflection;Prediction algorithms;Shape;Virtual environment;Visualization","acoustic wave propagation;acoustics;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","3D rendering class;adaptive beam tracing algorithm;adaptive beam tracing application;diffuse sound propagation;managed DirectX API;missing reflection;predicted acoustics;real time acoustic rendering;reflected beams;reflecting surface shape;room acoustics prediction;spurious avoidance;virtual environment aural simulation;virtual environment auralisation;virtual environment generation;virtual environment visual simulation;virtual environment visualisation","","1","","9","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the second path, 3 modes instead of 9 modes are chosen for RDO to decide the best mode for 4times4 block. Finally, the two modes determined in the two-path decision process are compared to decide the final block mode. Experimental results show that the computation time of the proposed method is decreased to about 77% of the exhaustive mode decision method with negligible quality loss.","","978-1-4244-4129-7;9781424441297","978-1-4244-4131-0;9781424441310","10.1109/CISP.2009.5300918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5300918","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic voltage control;ISO standards;Image edge detection;Optimization methods;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Probability;Rate-distortion;Video coding","optimisation;rate distortion theory;video coding","H.264/AVC video coding standard;directional gradients;fast intra mode decision algorithm;rate distortion optimization method;two-path decision process;two-path structure","","1","","7","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Xia","California Institute of Technology, USA","INFOCOM, 2011 Proceedings IEEE","20110630","2011","","","766","774","Random linear network codes can be designed and implemented in a distributed manner, with low computational complexity. However, these codes are classically implemented over finite fields whose size depends on some global network parameters (size of the network, the number of sinks) that may be unknown prior to code design. Also, the entire network code may have to be redesigned when a new node joins. In this work, we present the first universal and robust distributed linear network coding schemes. Our schemes are universal since they are independent of all network parameters. They are robust since in case nodes join or leave, the remaining nodes do not need to change their coding operations and the receivers can still decode. They are distributed since nodes need only have topological information about the part of the network upstream of them, which can be naturally streamed as part of the communication protocol. We present both probabilistic and deterministic schemes that are all asymptotically rate-optimal in the coding block-length, and have guarantees of correctness. Our probabilistic designs are computationally efficient, with order-optimal complexity. Our deterministic designs guarantee zero error decoding, albeit via codes with high computational complexity in general. Our coding schemes are based on network codes over “scalable fields”. Instead of choosing coding coefficients from one field at every node as in, each node uses linear coding operations over an “effective field-size” which depends on the node's distance from the source node. The analysis of our schemes requires technical tools that may be of independent interest. In particular, we generalize the Schwartz-Zippel lemma by proving a nonuniform version, wherein variables are chosen from sets of possibly different sizes. We also provide a novel robust distributed algorithm to assign unique IDs to network nodes.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935297","","Computational modeling","computational complexity;linear codes;network coding;probability;random codes","Schwartz-Zippel lemma;computational complexity;deterministic schemes;error decoding;global network parameters;probabilistic schemes;random linear network codes;robust distributed linear network codes;universal distributed linear network codes","","1","","24","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we report the results of a detailed analysis of a publicly available dataset, the 2003 / 2004 wireless traces from the CRAWDAD repository at Dartmouth. This dataset contains packet headers captured from the Dartmouth wireless network between November 2003 and February 2004, a period in which numerous worms were being observed in the wild. IP packet headers were converted to ldquodegeneraterdquo NetFlow records (1 flow record per packet) and the resulting flow files analyzed using the SiLKtools. Our approach was to use information available on worm and virus outbreaks during the period covered by the data and to use this information to develop profiles for each worm that could be used detect the presence of the wormin the traffic. The initial analysis involved manually studying the traffic for some key ports exploited by worms and looking for changes in network traffic which would give us time windows to filter the traffic for more detailed analysis. In addition to identifying many of the worms active during the period, we observed a number of related phenomena. The initial analysis showed heavy ICMP traffic from early November till second week of January after which it suddenly drops. We also observed sudden appearance of peaks in the SMTP traffic (possibly the result of Mass mailing worms, but more likely due to other causes) throughout the Dataset. In addition to reporting our findings for this data set, we hope that the description of our techniques will serve as a guide for others undertaking similar analyses. We note that the anonymization of the IP addresses and the requirement that we not attempt to break it resulted in our inability to investigate some behaviours in the traffic completely.","","978-1-4244-5344-3;9781424453443","978-0-7695-3805-1;9780769538051","10.1109/CONGRESS.2009.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341715","","Computer worms;Data analysis;Data security;Education;Filters;Niobium;Payloads;Privacy;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","IP networks;computer viruses;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CRAWDAD repository;Dartmouth wireless network;ICMP traffic;IP addresses;IP packet headers;NetFlow analysis;SMTP traffic;SiLKtools;anonymization;mass mailing worms;network traffic;publicly available dataset;virus outbreaks;worm analysis;worm behaviors;worm outbreaks","","0","","26","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Physical failures that occur in these devices will cause some conditions that are hard to test. Due to high impedance states, CMOS stuck-open faults require test pattern pairs (I, T) where I denotes an initialization pattern and pattern T performs the test. Test pairs of this type must be determined properly taking into account the possibilities of a charge loss during the transition from I to T. A novel algorithm is presented that finds such test pairs that are valid, even in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays. Based on a delay model a method was developed to determine test pairs even for such cases when other algorithms will fail.

High harmonic generation (HHG) in an ionizing medium has distinguishing characteristics among the methods of the generation of coherent extreme ultraviolet light. The shortest wavelength has reached into the water window region. The high-harmonic pulsewidth were measured to be shorter than the driving laser pulse width. Recently, a guiding technique with an Ar-filled hollow fiber has been applied to HHG in order to control the phase matching condition, resulting in 100 times enhancement around the 25th harmonic. There remains the question of whether any harmonic can be enhanced by the macroscopic phase matching in the fiber. In order to clarify these issues, we made an experiment where Ar was replaced by Ne which was expected to generate shorter wavelength. In spite of various differences of experimental condition, harmonics near the cutoff order were also enhanced by two orders of magnitude in Ne, giving the similar intensity distribution to one obtained with a Ar-filled hollow fiber. In this paper, we report the phase-matched HHG by guided intense femtosecond pulses, using a hollow fiber-guided and self-guided laser pulses. Based on the experimental results, macroscopic and microscopic phase matching of high-order harmonics are discussed.","","1-55752-576-X;155752576X","","10.1109/QELS.1999.807375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807375","","Argon;Character generation;Fiber lasers;Frequency conversion;Laser beam cutting;Optical pulses;Pulse measurements;Space vector pulse width modulation;Ultraviolet sources;Wavelength measurement","high-speed optical techniques;light coherence;optical harmonic generation;optical pumping","Ar-filled hollow fiber;absolute conversion efficiency;cutoff region;elongated propagation;guided femtosecond pulses;hollow fiber-guided pulses;macroscopic phase matching;microscopic phase matching;phase-matched high-order-harmonic generation;self-guided laser pulses","","0","","5","","","23-28 May 1992","23 May 1999-28 May 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, using steepest descent and a simulated path-type channel derived from measured data, we adapt the element locations.

This process utilizes three additional steps carried out prior to the CMOS fabrication sequence.

We proposed an improved morphological index for measuring the degree of organization in AEGs. As for other indexes, the metric provides an estimate of the probability of founding couples of similar waves and it increases with a higher AF organization. However, it also considers the order of arrival of the wavefronts on a set of bipolar electrodes (BE). Doing so, the index is inherently influenced by the direction of propagation of the wavefronts. To quantify organization, the AEGs were encoded with sequences of words of six symbols: three describing the order of arrival of the wavefronts on the BEs, while the others depending on the shape of each wave. The organization degree (OD) of each AEG was finally obtained as a function of the entropy of the sequence of words. The method was tested on 10 subjects before and after infusion of isoproterenol (ISO). During sinus rhythm, the effects of ISO did not significantly altered the organization of the atria (on average OD= 0.75 before and 0.74 after). Instead, in atrial fibrillation, ISO significantly reduced the level of organization (OD= 0.35 before vs 0.32 after, p <; 0.05, paired t-test). The results were coherent with the pharmacological effects expected from the drug.","0276-6574;02766574","978-1-4673-2076-4;9781467320764","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6420518","","Electric variables measurement;Electrodes;Entropy;Indexes;Organizations;Shape","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;drug delivery systems;drugs;electrocardiography;encoding;medical signal processing;probability","ablation treatment;atrial electrogram;atrial fibrillation oganization;bipolar electrodes;drug;electrical activity organization measurement;electrocardiography;isoproterenol infusion;morphological index;paired t-testing;pharmacological effects;probability;sinus rhythm;symbolic analysis;wavefront propagation;word sequence encoding","","0","","8","","","9-12 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of the experiments is to assess the effectiveness of this technique when used with pictures that were previously modified using several common image-processing functions coming with photo-editing tools. The results seem to confirm that, in most cases, the method by Lukáš et al. is resilient to the modifications introduced by the considered image-processing functions.

It has been shown that memristors are naturally suited for performing implication logic (combination of implication and false operation) instead of Boolean logic. Also, it should be noted that a memristor can be used as both a logic gate and a latch (stateful logic). Being functionally complete, implication logic can be used to compute any Boolean function. However, by performing implication logic with stateful devices, storage of intermediate results requires additional memristors to keep data yet to be used from being written over. This paper describes an effective way to compute any Boolean function with a small number of memristors. Also, the length of the corresponding computing sequence is considered.","2327-8218;23278218","978-1-4244-4957-6;9781424449576","978-1-4244-4958-3;9781424449583","10.1109/NANOARCH.2009.5226356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226356","","Automatic control;Automation;Computer aided instruction;Computer science;Computer science education;Educational technology;Instruments;Logic;Memristors;Military computing","Boolean functions","Boolean function;Boolean logic;computing sequence;logic gate;logic operation;memristors;stateful implication logic;stateful logic","","35","3","4","","","30-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel nano-photonic quantum dots optical fiber (NQDOF) to investigate its nonlinear properties for future photonic communications. We employ both nano and photonic crystal fiber technologies in NQWOF where an InP is chosen as quantum dots in the core of optical fiber. In addition, we conduct a numerical study of nonlinear parameter for developed NQDOF using Femlab.

While radio and television have managed to use advertising as their primary revenue source, most media, newspapers and magazines had to use a hybrid approach, combining revenue from advertising and subscriptions. By far the most profitable venue for on-line advertising has been search, and much of the effectiveness of search advertising comes from the “adwords” model of matching search queries to advertisements. This paper is to survey of algorithms for optimizing the way this assignment is done. The algorithms used are of an unusual type; they are greedy and they are “on-line” in a particular technical sense to be discussed. This paper discusses these two algorithmic issues - greediness and on-line algorithms - in general, before tackling the adwords problem. A second interesting on-line advertising problem involves selecting items to advertise at an on-line store. This problem involves “collaborative filtering,” where it try to find customers with similar behaviour in order to suggest they buy things that similar customers have bought.","","978-1-4799-3063-0;9781479930630","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056969","Adwords;collaborative filterin;greedy algorithm;online algorithm;online-matching","Abstracts;Bridges","advertising data processing;collaborative filtering;query processing;search engines","advertisement assignment;adwords model;collaborative filtering;greediness algorithm;keyword searching;online advertising;online algorithm;search advertising;search query matching","","0","","14","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper formulated a new point of view for modular chip mounters based on the already known feeder assignment problem and head motion problem applying the global optimization using the nonsorting dominance genetic algorithm the NSGAH in regard of the total cycle time reduction.

But as applications for it proliferate at an accelerating rate, government regulators, including those in the United States, are having a hard time keeping up. It's vital that they do, because foot dragging on their part threatens to slow the pace of innovation. If you have any doubts, read on and discover just how deeply radar has integrated itself into the fabric of modern industrial society, despite what I regard as a problematic regulatory environment. It's a cautionary tale, and though I'm concerned with radar here, the warning is relevant to many technologies-including drones, app-based ride sharing, and cryptocurrencies, to mention just a few.","0018-9235;00189235","","","10.1109/MSPEC.2015.7024512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024512","","Aircraft;Command and control systems;History;Military communications;Radar tracking","innovation management;radar applications","aircraft detection;app-based ride sharing;cryptocurrencies;government regulators;innovation;modern industrial society;radar speed guns;technologies-including drones","","1","","","","","February 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm recursively computes the TDFT at arbitrary frequency with integrated triangular windowing. A common way to compute TDFT with window is to firstly multiply the input data by the window function and then carry out the TDFT on the windowed data. In this paper, we show that the TDFT with triangular window at a given frequency satisfies a complex-coefficient second-order difference equation. To compute the TDFT, only seven complex multiplications and six additions are needed. The window can be a family of triangular functions, including the Bartlett window and the Welch window of the first order. Our result is useful for estimating single, few, or unevenly distributed frequencies.","","","","10.1109/ICCE-TW.2015.7216882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7216882","","Conferences;Difference equations;Discrete Fourier transforms;Fast Fourier transforms;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms","Fourier transforms;difference equations;digital filters","Bartlett window;TDFT;Welch window;complex-coefficient second-order difference equation;digital filtering;generalized triangular windows;integrated triangular windowing;sliding Fourier transform;time-dependent Fourier transform;triangular functions","","0","","7","","","6-8 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We further combine median-shift with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and show that the combined algorithm is suitable for clustering large scale, high dimensional data sets. In particular, we propose a new mode detection step that greatly accelerates performance. In the past, LSH was used in conjunction with mean shift only to accelerate nearest neighbor queries. Here we show that we can analyze the density of the LSH bins to quickly detect potential mode candidates and use only them to initialize the median-shift procedure. We use the median, instead of the mean (or its discrete counterpart - the medoid) because the median is more robust and because the median of a set is a point in the set. A median is well defined for scalars but there is no single agreed upon extension of the median to high dimensional data. We adopt a particular extension, known as the Tukey median, and show that it can be computed efficiently using random projections of the high dimensional data onto 1D lines, just like LSH, leading to a tightly integrated and efficient algorithm.","1550-5499;15505499","978-1-4244-4420-5;9781424444205","978-1-4244-4419-9;9781424444199","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459423","","Acceleration;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Computer vision;Convergence;Large-scale systems;Nearest neighbor searches;Robustness;Shape","computer vision;object detection;pattern clustering;random processes","Tukey median;locality sensitive hashing;median-shift procedure;mode seeking algorithm;mode-detection;random projection","","7","","21","","","Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme is intrinsically distributed and well suited for an ad hoc scenario. It is shown analytically and through simulation that the capacity region of opportunistic collaboration is equal to or larger than (centralized) optimal multi-hop in case spatial reuse is not allowed by the transmission protocol. On the other hand, in case spatial reuse is possible, the relation between the two capacity regions has to be studied case by case.

In this paper we present an event-based thermal control scheme, capable of guaranteeing safe operation with a low effort. We also show how the proposed solution can be divided into a hardware and a software part, further improving efficiency.

Issues addressed using this approach include - determining the intra-cellular response of bone cells to mechanical stimulus, bone response to different mechanical loading conditions, the role of intra-cellular feedback regulation in bone remodeling, and the link between reduced mechanical loading and decreased bone mass. An inter-connected network of signal transduction pathways in osteoblasts and osteoclasts is considered for modeling. The salient features of this modeling technique are systems biology based network modeling to simulate the temporal dynamics of the signaling proteins, parameter estimation based on evolutionary computing, and control systems theory to model feedback in the signaling network. The results indicate that signaling networks respond uniquely to different mechanical stimuli, the stimulus signal is gradually attenuated in the signaling cascade, and the disruption of intra-cellular feedback regulation leads to decreased bone formation in osteoblasts and increased bone resorption in osteoclasts. This results in low bone mass, a phenomenon generally observed in reduced loading conditions. It is deduced that reduced mechanical loading leads to disruption in the feedback to result in low bone mass. The results of these simulation studies are expected to serve as useful guidelines for planning relevant experimental work to study the effect of mechanical loading on bone at cellular level.","","978-1-4244-2844-1;9781424428441","978-1-4244-2845-8;9781424428458","10.1109/BIBE.2008.4696734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696734","","Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Bones;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Control system synthesis;Feedback;Parameter estimation;Proteins;Systems biology","biomechanics;bone;cellular biophysics","bone mechanotransduction;bone resorption;intracellular feedback regulation;intracellular response;mechanoregulation;osteoblasts;osteoclasts;signal transduction pathways;systems analysis","","0","","34","","","8-10 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on","20030826","2003","1","","224","229 vol.1","The temporal correlation hypothesis proposes using distributed synchrony for the binding stimulus features. However, synchronized spikes must travel over cortical circuits that have varying-length pathways, leading to mismatched arrival times. This raises the question of how initial stimulus-dependent synchrony might be preserved at a destination binding site. Earlier, we proposed constraints on tolerance and segregation parameters for a phase-coding approach, within cortical circuits, to address this question [C. Gunay et. al., July 2001] The purpose of the present paper is twofold. First, we conduct simulation experiments to test the proposed constraints. Second, we explore the practicality of temporal binding to drive a process of long-term memory formation based on a recruitment learning method [J.A. Feldman, 1982]. A network based on Valiant's neuroidal architecture [Leslie G. Valiant, 1994] is used to demonstrate the coalition between temporal binding and recruitment. Complementing similar approaches, we implement a continuous-time learning procedure allowing computation with spiking neurons. Our results indicate that when tolerance and segregation parameters obey our proposed constraints, the assemblies of correct bindings are dominant over assemblies of spurious bindings in reasonable operating conditions.","1098-7576;10987576","0-7803-7898-9;0780378989","","10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223348","","Assembly;Biological system modeling;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Cognitive science;Computer architecture;Delay lines;Learning systems;Neurons;Recruitment","biocybernetics;cognitive systems;continuous time systems;correlation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","Valiant neuroidal architecture;connectionist recruitment learning;continuous-time learning procedure;cortical circuits;delayed lines;distributed synchrony;long-term memory formation;phase segregation;phase-coding approach;recruitment learning algorithm;segregation parameter;spiking neurons;stimulus dependent synchrony;temporal binding;temporal correlation hypothesis;tolerance parameter;tolerance window;varying-length pathways","","0","","21","","","20-24 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, randomness is quantified by the size of the corresponding smoothing error and deterministic processes are characterized by integrability of the inverse of their power spectral densities - as opposed to the log-integrability in the classical setting. The power spectrum which is consistent with a partial autocorrelation sequence and corresponds to the most random (MR) process in this new sense, is no longer rational but generated by finitely many fractional-poles.","0018-9448;00189448","","","10.1109/TIT.2007.901149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276920","Entropy rate;predictability;randomness;smoothing;time-arrow","Autocorrelation;Context modeling;Entropy;Power generation;Predictive models;Random processes;Sensor arrays;Smoothing methods;Spectral analysis;Time series analysis","maximum entropy methods;random processes;smoothing methods;spectral analysis","deterministic process characterization;fractional-pole model;maximum entropy principle;partial autocorrelation sequence;power spectral density;power spectrum selection;random process;randomness quantification;smoothing error;time-series analysis","","3","","16","","","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It offers fixed size unsolicited data grants on a real-time periodic basis to meet the periodic transmission requirements. However, the synchronization mismatch between these two periodic behaviours may lead to a possible delay. To combat this delay, a form of grant synchronization mechanism must be employed for UGS. In this paper, grant synchronization for 802.16 is studied. Some mechanisms are given to reduce the delay derived from synchronization mismatch. At the same time, the jitter introduced from these mechanisms is also taken into consideration.

The breakdown strength of PVDF with a BTO nanofiller was almost same regardless of a BTO content but the breakdown strength of PVDF with a BTO nanofiller was lower than that without a BTO nanofiller. The conduction current of PVDF with a BTO nanofiller also increase, compared to that without a BTO nanofiller, suggesting that the increased conduction current due to the increase in some carriers related to the addition of a BTO nanofiller leads to breakdown. In the space charge measurement, the induced charge polarities on PVDF with a BTO nanofiller were reversed compared to the applied voltage. The magnitude of the pressure wave from the surface polarization charge generated at the interface between the electrode and the sample increased qualitatively compared to that from the induced charge. The negative space charge was accumulated in the bulk of PVDF with a BTO nanofiller just prior to the voltage application and the negative space charge in the bulk decreased as the voltage application time increased. From these results, it was suggested that the breakdown was due to the increase in the conduction current, which is controlled by the space charge.","0084-9162;00849162","","","10.1109/CEIDP.2014.6995834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6995834","","Breakdown voltage;Charge measurement;Current measurement;Electric breakdown;Electrodes;Space charge;Voltage measurement","barium compounds;electric breakdown;nanocomposites;organic insulating materials;polarisation;space charge","BTO nanocomoposites;BTO nanofiller;DC voltage application;PVDF conduction current;PVDF nanocomoposites;barium titanium oxide;breakdown strength;conduction current;negative space charge;polyvinylidene fluoride;space charge distribution;space charge measurement;surface polarization charge","","0","","5","","","19-22 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This degradation of the cable performance seems to be due to various factors, among which the strain state of the filaments due to bending and contact phenomena inside the cable. After these results it was decided that high performance strands will be used for ITER magnets, even if they have never been tested on a full size cable. Therefore the capability of evaluating the coil performance from the strands characteristics becomes a crucial point in the Research and Development (R&D) activity. Recently some extrapolations were attempted, but the mechanical model used is rather simplified and needs some fitting parameters which are not known a priori. In this work we present a thermo-mechanical model suitably developed to evaluate the strain state of a Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn strand inside a superconducting (SC) cable. It is based on the idea of multiscale modeling, starting from a enriched formulation of the beam kinematics to take into account the fibrous nature of a multifilamentary strand. The method consists in performing a successive substitution of discrete models involving many beams with a single equivalent beam model, which behavior is identified from the preceding cabling stage. This recursive substitution allows to perform the analysis within a reasonable computational time. Once the stress and strain fields are obtained at the higher level, a suitable unsmearing technique gives the strain till the first level, on the scale of the SC filament. The method is applied to the real case of the 3 times 3 and 3 times 3 times 5 CICC sub-size samples tested at FZK in Germany.","1051-8223;10518223","","","10.1109/TASC.2007.897759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4277301","Composite beam model;ITER superconducting cable;multiscale analysis;thermal and bending strain","Capacitive sensors;Degradation;Magnetic field induced strain;Magnets;Niobium;Superconducting cables;Superconducting coils;Testing;Thermomechanical processes;Tin","bending;fusion reactor materials;magnets;stress-strain relations;superconducting cables","ITER magnets;ITER superconducting cables;Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn based cables;beam kinematics;bending;contact phenomena;discrete models;multifilamentary strand;multiscale modeling;stress-strain fields;thermomechanical model","","3","","21","","","June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We have studied the nonlinear evolution of Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability in solid aluminum liners. Two-dimensional MHD modeling of the configuration have been performed using the measured current pulseform of the PEGASUS II capacitor bank as a magnetic field source. The liner configuration consisted of a solid aluminum annulus 20 mm long and 0.4 mm thick. The outer surface of the liner was machined with a sinusoidal ripple. Half of the liner was scribed with one wavelength, the other half with another wavelength. A series of experiments was conducted with a smooth surface and ripple wavelengths of 0.5, 0.75, and 2.0 mm. The peak-to-peak ripple amplitude was varied between 0.025 and 0.10 mm, but the ration of the initial amplitude to wavelength never exceeded 7%. Diagnostics consisted of radiography, a center-conductor B-dot probe, and transmission line pulsed power diagnostics. The inner surfaces of the liners were coated with a thin film of gold (Au) to permit measurement of material deformation at various stages of the instability growth. Three radiographs, at different times, were taken for each experiment. The center-conductor magnetic probe was used to measure the magnetic field penetration through the liner. Initial comparisons between the data and the MHD calculations showed excellent agreement with respect to nonlinear instability growth and with the time of field rupture of the liner.","0730-9244;07309244","0-7803-3990-8;0780339908","","10.1109/PLASMA.1997.605050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=605050","","Aluminum;Diagnostic radiography;Gold;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetohydrodynamics;Performance evaluation;Probes;Pulse measurements;Transmission line measurements;Wavelength measurement","Rayleigh-Taylor instability;aluminium;plasma diagnostics;plasma instability;plasma magnetohydrodynamics","0.025 to 0.1 mm;0.4 mm;0.5 to 2 mm;20 mm;Al;B-dot probe;PEGASUS II capacitor bank;diagnostics;liner configuration;magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities;magnetic field source;nonlinear instability growth;radiography;sinusoidal ripple;smooth surface;solid aluminum annulus;solid aluminum liners;solid liners;thin film;transmission line pulsed power diagnostics;two-dimensional MHD modeling","","0","","","","","19-22 May 1997","19 May 1997-22 May 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the current study, we isolate a form of pure limb motor plasticity. Participants reached to targets that were turned off just after the onset of an initial eye movement, reappearing at a new location at the end of the reaching movement. In contrast to classical prism or virtual reality paradigms, our task eliminated sensory adaptation by always maintaining a congruency between the seen and felt limb position. We also minimized awareness and potential adaptation processes on the basis of volitional strategies by progressively increasing the size of the target perturbations. In this manner, our adaptation procedure mimicked conditions used to study saccadic adaptation. The results indicated that adaptation under these conditions led to a robust after-effect that generalized to a large range of movements within the workspace. This fully natural, nonim-posed generalization of adaptation is not expressed in a spatial coordinate system, but more likely in a joint-centered coordinate space.","0898-929X;0898929X","","","10.1162/089892906775250058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789546","","","","","","0","","","","","Jan. 1 2006","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Precision of the resection can be improved by utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an aid in decision making during image guided neurosurgery (IGNS). Image registration adjusts pre-operative data according to intra-operative tissue deformation. Some of the approaches increase the registration accuracy by tracking image landmarks through the whole brain volume. High computational cost used to render these techniques inappropriate for clinical applications. In this paper we present a parallel implementation of a state of the art registration method, and a number of needed incremental improvements. Overall, we reduced the response time for registration of an average dataset from about an hour and for some cases more than an hour to less than seven minutes, which is within the time constraints imposed by neurosurgeons.

The presence of such a user will influence the RF signal paths between a body-worn node and the receiving nodes. This influence will vary with the user's location and orientation and, as a result, will deteriorate the performance regarding location tracking. By using multiple mobile nodes, placed on different parts of a human body, we exploit the fact that the combination of multiple measured signal strengths will show less variation caused by the user's body. Another method is to compensate explicitly for the influence of the body by using the user's orientation toward the fixed infrastructure nodes. Both approaches can be independently combined and reduce the influence caused by body shadowing, hereby improving the tracking accuracy. The overall system performance is extensively verified on a building-wide testbed for sensor experiments. The results show a significant improvement in tracking accuracy. The total improvement in mean accuracy is 38.1% when using three mobile nodes instead of one and simultaneously compensating for the user's orientation.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2508002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353120","Human Body Shadowing;Indoor Environment;Localization;Tracking;Tracking, Localization;Wireless Sensor Network;human body shadowing;indoor environment;localization;wireless sensor network","Biological system modeling;Indoor environments;Mobile communication;Prediction algorithms;RF signals;Sensors;Shadow mapping","indoor environment;target tracking;wireless sensor networks","body shadowing compensation;human body shadowing;indoor environment;indoor location tracking;radiofrequency-based location tracking system;tracking accuracy;wireless sensor network","","","","29","","2015-12-11","April1, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We address the short comings of the commonly used time-frequency linear transform in multichannel settings, namely the classical short-time-Fourier-transform (cSTFT). We propose a series of desirable properties for the linear transform used in a multichannel source separation scenario: stationary invertibility, relative delay, relative attenuation, and finally delay invariant relative windowed-disjoint orthogonality (DIRWDO). Multisensor source separation techniques which operate in the time-frequency domain, have an inherent error unless consideration is given to the multichannel properties proposed in this paper. The sSTFT preserves these relationships for multichannel data. The crucial innovation of the sSTFT is to locally synchronize the analysis to the observations as opposed to a global clock. Improvement in separation performance can be achieved because assumed properties of the time-frequency transform are satisfied when it is appropriately synchronized. Numerical experiments show the sSTFT improves instantaneous subsample relative parameter estimation in low noise conditions and achieves good synthesis.","1053-587X;1053587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2088392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5605264","Signal analysis;source separation","Delay;Fourier transforms;Signal processing algorithms;Speech;Synchronization;Time frequency analysis","Fourier transforms;parameter estimation;source separation;synchronisation","anechoic mixtures;delay invariant relative windowed-disjoint orthogonality;multichannel source separation;parameter estimation;short time Fourier transform;synchronized linear transform;time frequency domain;time frequency linear transform","","2","","31","","2010-10-18","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is found that the patch size and the central cylindrical metal via radius can be used as a major means to tune the antenna resonant frequency and good impedance matching can be achieved by adjusting the feed position. Also, the spacing between patch elements and the ground plane size are the key parameters in determining the radiation characteristics.","","1-4244-1049-5;1424410495","1-4244-1049-5;1424410495","10.1109/ICMMT.2007.381276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4266035","","Antenna arrays;Antenna feeds;Antenna radiation patterns;Communication switching;Communication system control;Impedance matching;Parametric study;Resonant frequency;Switches;Wireless communication","antenna radiation patterns;planar antenna arrays","antenna resonant frequency;central cylindrical metal;feed location;ground plane size;hexagonal patch size;impedance matching;multiple radiation patterns;patch elements spacing;planar switched parasitic array antenna;wireless communication","","3","","3","","","18-21 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These memories are almost optimal in terms of the amount of storage they require (efficiency) and allow retrieving messages with low complexity. We propose a generic implementation model for the retrieval algorithm that can be readily mapped to an integrated circuit and study the retrieval performance when hardware components are affected by faults. We show using analytical and simulation results that these associative memories can be made resilient to circuit faults with a minor modification of the retrieval algorithm. In one example, the memory retains 88% of its efficiency when 1% of the storage cells are faulty, or 98% when 0.1% of the binary outputs of the retrieval algorithm are faulty. When considering storage faults, the fault tolerance exhibited by the proposed associative memory can be comparable to using a capacity-achieving error correction code for protecting the stored information.","1053-587X;1053587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2015.2489600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296693","Associative memory;digital integrated circuits;error correction codes;fault tolerant systems","Associative memory;Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Signal processing algorithms;Simulation","content-addressable storage;graph theory","c-partite graphs;capacity-achieving error correction code;fault-tolerant associative memories;integrated circuit;retrieval algorithm","","1","","31","","2015-10-12","Feb.15, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Commercially available RF ablation generators, unlike cryoablation (a method of tumor destruction that utilizes cold rather than heat), are only capable of driving a single RF probe at a time. Using multiple probes simultaneously in RF ablation is desirable for treating large tumors and for treating multiple tumor metastases. Bipolar RF ablation, which has been previously studied by other groups, allows simultaneous usage of two probes. The energy converted to heat at each probe for bipolar RF ablation is necessarily equal. There have been no investigations of other methods that allow usage of multiple RF probes simultaneously. We investigated the feasibility of a new method, where power is applied in an alternating fashion between two or more probes. This method allows independent control of the amount of energy deposited at each probe. We performed ex-vivo experiments with one (i.e. conventional ablation) and with two probes.

The scatterers modeling the medium are uniformly spatially distributed and have scattering coefficients modeled by a K-distribution. The concentration of scatterers and the statistics of their amplitude determine the statistics of the RF signals.

It combines mean shift with watershed algorithm to get robust results. First, mean shift procedure is used to find the highest density regions which correspond to clusters centered on the modes (local maxima) of the underlying probability distribution in the feature space. The principal component of each significant color is extracted by mode. Second, homogeneous regions corresponding to the modes are as markers to label an image, then marker-controlled watershed transformation is applied to the image segmentation. The segmentation of blood cells is discussed. The input parameters are a few initial color markers that represent significant colors. By combining both methods, the oversegmentation is able to be prevented, touching and overlapping nucleated cells can be separated, and running time is reduced too.

Many authors already use this integrated method to investigate interest areas in, both, commercial and scientific aspect. In this direction the current study initiated in 2009 in the frame of the Geochemistry Network PETROBRAS/CENPES, aims to track the quaternary evolution of a muddy bank situated at the coastal western boundary upwelling system (WBUS) off Cabo Frio (23°S) in the Atlantic Ocean. The WBUS is located at the north coast of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Here the coastline orientation differs from the default East-West direction of the Brazilian coast, concomitant with the boundary of the Campos and Santos Basins, the most important oil and gas basins of the country. The upwelling phenomenon occurs due to constant northeast winds. The same winds combined with the Northeast-Southwest coastline orientation also promote a curl confluence making the environment even more complex. Seismic data was acquired in cruises on board the RV Ocean Survey. Altogether 680 km was covered by a 3.5 KHz sub-bottom using the Geopulse Geoacustic System. Further, four piston cores were collected to be scan and described in physic parameters and sedimentological content, respectively. The scan was performed using a Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL), which measure and register the Vp, gamma density and porosity of the core. After the scan, the cores were sample and analyzed on sedimentological grain size distribution determined by a Cilas 1064 laser analyzer. The results were integrated in order to identify common trends. Three major echo-characters were described in seismic records. Grain size analysis presented a good relationship with these echos. Echo A) Transparent, represented by a sharp bottom reflector with no sub-bottom reflectors scatter of a transparent layer mapped in seismic records. T- e grain size distribution is more balanced with a slight higher content of sands (55 %) in the correspondent core. Echo B) Stratified described as a series of parallel sub-bottom horizons, its percentage of clays is the highest of the three cores (77 %). The last echo, C) Reflexive, is a prolonged echo with one or none sub-bottom reflector. This echo is related to the highest percentage of sands of the three cores (61%). The sediment analysis was extrapolated all over the echo-characters extension to understand the transport regime over the area. This criteria, allied to isopach map, made possible to recognize three distinct zones inside the muddy accumulation.","","","","10.1109/RIOAcoustics.2013.6683991","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6683991","3.5 kHz;High resolution seismic;SBP","Acoustics;Geology;Grain size;Hydrodynamics;Impedance;Sea measurements;Sediments","oceanographic regions;seafloor phenomena;sediments;underwater acoustic propagation","Atlantic Ocean;Brazil;Cabo Frio;Campos basin;Cilas laser analyzer;Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger;Northeast-Southwest coastline orientation;PETROBRAS-CENPES geochemistry network;RV Ocean survey;Rio de Janeiro State;Santos basin;acoustic pattern variation;coastal western boundary upwelling system;coastline orientation;core porosity;echo-character identification;gamma density;geopulse geoacustic system;grain size analysis;integrated method;isopach map;muddy bank quaternary evolution;northeast winds;piston cores;sediment distribution;sedimentological content;sedimentological grain size distribution;seismic data;sharp bottom reflector;upwelling system","","0","","15","","","24-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We compare two classes of films: 1) blend films of ZnPc and C<sub>60</sub> prepared by co-evaporation, and 2) superlattice films from alternating neat layers of ZnPc and C<sub>60</sub>, where the individual layer varies in thickness between 2 nm and 40 nm. These films are model structures for the charge generation layers in organic photovoltaics, and their photo-carrier dynamics on a femtosecond to nanosecond timescale is of high interest. Using TRTS, which employs an optical pump pulse and a time delayed terahertz (THz) probe pulse, we find evidence for a short-lived charge transfer state of C<sub>60</sub> that decays within several picoseconds of excitation. Both blend and superlattice films have a long-lived (>80 picoseconds) THz absorption that is dependent on the structure and composition of the films. The optimum composition for maximum photo-carrier generation efficiency is a 1:1 blend of ZnPc and C<sub>60</sub>. Amongst the layered films, we find that the photo-carrier efficiency increases as the individual layer thickness decreases, with the film having ultrathin alternating 2 nm thick layers exhibiting the strongest THz absorption. A much stronger THz absorption signal was obtained for the 2 nm layered film than for the best blend film.","0160-8371;01608371","978-1-4244-5890-5;9781424458905","","10.1109/PVSC.2010.5616508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616508","","","charge exchange;fullerenes;optical pumping;organic semiconductors;semiconductor superlattices;semiconductor thin films;solar cells;terahertz spectroscopy;vacuum deposition;zinc compounds","THz absorption signal;TRTS;blended film;buckminsterfullerene;charge generation layer;coevaporation;multilayered film;optical pump pulse;organic photovoltaics;organic thin film;photocarrier generation;photoinduced carrier dynamics;superlattice film;time delayed terahertz probe pulse;time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy;ultrathin film;zinc phthalocyanine","","0","","7","","","20-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to the TW-TOA information, ELSA exploits the implicit audibility information (or outage information) to improve detection rates of location spoofing attacks. Given TW-TOA and audibility information, we derive the decision rule for the verification of the device’s location, based on the generalized likelihood ratio test.We develop a practical threat model for delay measurements spoofing scenarios, and investigate in detail the performance of ELSA in terms of detection and false alarm rates.

"Comparison of SOI and Partial-SOI LDMOSFETs Using Electrical–Thermal–Stress Coupled-Field Effect","C. M. Tan; G. Huang","Sch. of Electr. &amp; Electron. Eng., Nanyang Technol.

In this paper, we perform E-T-S coupled-field simulation from the first principle by considering the stress-induced modification of the Si band structures and employ FEA software COMSOL to apply the E-T-S model on lateral double-diffused MOS field-effect transistors (LDMOSFETs) as an example. From the comparison of the electrical characteristics computed using the models with and without the mechanical stress caused by material thermal mismatch in the device structures, we found that the effect of the mechanical stress is insignificant in the forward-bias condition but it does have impact in the reverse-bias condition, namely, the reverse leakage current is higher if the mechanical stress is considered. Simulations are performed on two types of LDMOSFETs, namely, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and partial-SOI (PSOI) LDMOSFETs, because the temperature and mechanical stress distributions are very different in these LDMOSFETs even under the same operating conditions. From the comparison of the computational results of SOI and PSOI LDMOSFETs, the results indicate that PSOI power LDMOSFET structure enables efficient heat conduction from the hot junctions and offers higher breakdown voltage.","0018-9383;00189383","","","10.1109/TED.2011.2162588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995159","Electrical–thermal–stress (E–T–S) coupled field;finite-element analysis (FEA);partial silicon-on-insulator (PSOI);power lateral double-diffused MOS field-effect transistors (LDMOSFETs);stress-induced band structure modification","Computational modeling;Heating;Logic gates;Performance evaluation;Silicon;Stress;Thermomechanical processes","elemental semiconductors;finite element analysis;heat conduction;leakage currents;power MOSFET;silicon;silicon-on-insulator;temperature distribution;thermal stresses","E-T-S coupled-field effect modeling;FEA software COMSOL;PSOI;Si;electrical-thermal-stress coupled-field effect modeling;finite-element analysis;forward-bias condition;heat conduction;hot junction;material thermal mismatch;mechanical stress distribution;partial-silicon-on-insulator;power LDMOSFET;power lateral double-diffused MOS field-effect transistor;reverse leakage current;reverse-bias condition;semiconductor device;stress-induced modification;temperature stress distribution;voltage breakdown","","0","","21","","2011-08-22","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It aims to become aware of distribution of spurious products with fake RFID tags and to provide a product authentication service to consumers with mobile RFID devices like mobile phone which has a RFID reader. We also propose an authentication mechanism between a tag and an information server through the device. The mechanism is designed to be appropriated for EPC Class-1 Generation-2 UHF tags. The tags, one of RFID tag types, is expected that most companies are planning to use it in the SCM in the short term and in consumer packaging in the long term due to its inexpensive cost. Because of the very cost, however, its resources are extremely scarce and it is hard to have any valuable security algorithms in it. It causes security vulnerabilities, in particular cloning the tags for counterfeits. The mechanism provides secure mutual authentication between a tag and a server. It can be applied to the mobile RFID environment that any mobile RFID reader can be placed in the interface between the tag and the server. It means that the mechanism provides secure communication between them even the reader is not trusted. On basis of this tag authentication, the service makes use of location information especially from LBS (location based service) of the consumers' devices. Thanks to it, the service can make fine-grained decision about authentication of a product. At the same time the server utilize the information to extend its management area where legacy SCM could not reach thanks to consumers' mobile RFID devices","0747-668X;0747668X","1-4244-0216-6;1424402166","","10.1109/ISCE.2006.1689423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1689423","Mobile RFID.

In order to stabilize the mobile crowdsourcing at a massive scale, incentive mechanisms are needed not only to stimulate the users of mobile phones to participate in sensing, but also to incentivize the organizer of the sensing tasks with maximum service time and payoff. In this paper, we study a practical problem in mobile sensing, i.e., sensing time uncertainty, which may lead to failures of existing incentive mechanisms. In particular, we model this problem as a perturbed Stackelberg game in which mobile phone users may actually conduct sensing tasks during different periods of time rather than what they intend, like through a trembling hand. We find that there exist Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibria (THP) given proper rewards. After characterizing THPs in this game with rigorous analysis, we design incentive mechanisms that can achieve a THP with the maximum system wide total sensing time and maximum platform utility. We finally verify the correctness and efficiency of our proposed incentive mechanisms and algorithms through extensive experiments.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2015.7248874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248874","","Algorithm design and analysis;Crowdsourcing;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Sensors;Uncertainty","game theory;mobile communication","THP;incentive mechanisms;mobile crowdsourcing;mobile phone sensing;perturbed Stackelberg game;trembling-hand perfect equilibria","","0","","36","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While active power is regulated at the storage device according to the charging and discharging status of battery, the voltage magnitude at the point of common coupling is regulated by the VSC. In addition, a comprehensive VSC-based PEV equivalent model that accurately reflects the behavior of a distributed vehicular fleet is proposed in this work to carry out efficient steady-state analyses. Consequently, power flow studies of electric power networks including large vehicular fleets can be performed with a low computational effort and without losing accuracy. A Tesla Roadster PEV including a lithium-ion battery pack and a single phase inverter is modeled with the proposal presented in this paper, considering both active and reactive power transfer conditions.

The antenna has beam widths of about 1.2Â° in right ascension and 8Â° in declination between half-power points. Radio maps, covering about 75 per cent of the sky, are presented in celestial and galactic coordinates. The greater resolving power of the antenna has revealed a number of fine features of the background radiation as well as numerous radio stars. Radio maps made at other frequencies by various groups are summarized. To present an over-all picture of the sky at different frequencies, eight maps are shown for frequencies from 64 mc to 910 mc. All maps are modified to have the same scale, coordinates and units to facilitate intercomparison. An intercomparison of these radio maps shows some consistent features of the galactic background radiation. These features may be represented by three symmetrical distributions and several unsymmetrical or irregular distributions. The symmetrical distributions are as follows: 1) a narrow belt about 3Â° wide lying in the galactic plane and concentrated towards the galactic center, 2) a very broad band of radiation concentrated within about 15Â° to 30Â° of galactic latitude and having its maximum near the galactic center, and 3) an approximately isotropic distribution.

This is convenient because the internal or implied open-circuit voltage of a solar cell can be measured at early stages of device processing (e.g., after passivation), giving rapid insight into expected device performance. However, these methods assume that recombination is linear in excess carrier density. In addition, both formulas also require that the ideality factor be known, and, while unity is often assumed, the ideality factor in fact varies with injection level. The expressions are often used in cases where these assumptions are clearly violated; here, we evaluate the accuracy in these cases. We find that the expressions are unable to predict the intrinsic FF generally, and their use must be restricted to very low or very high injection. We propose an alternative expression that is accurate for calculating the intrinsic-recombination-limited FF. With appropriate input parameters, e.g. wafer thickness, doping concentration and photogenerated current, the FF and Voc of solar cells can be predicted independent of each other. We investigate the accuracy of our proposed expression and see that its deviation from exact results are less than 0.3 % for FF and 1 mV for Voc.","","","","10.1109/PVSC.2015.7355950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7355950","Fill factor;Green expression;Recombination;silicon","Electrical resistance measurement;Green products;Photovoltaic cells;Resistance;Silicon;Surface treatment;Voltage measurement","semiconductor doping;solar cells","doping concentration;intrinsic fill factor;maximum obtainable fill factor;photogenerated current;solar cells;wafer thickness","","","","7","","","14-19 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the case of a bottleneck processing step, the adjustment rate for P3D is the lowest; as a result, the P3D throughput is the highest. Moreover, the response time for P3D is about 65% shorter than that for FCFS, and the tardiness for P3D is about 28% less than that for SPT. In the case of a non-bottleneck processing step, SPT and P3D produce almost equal average response times, and FCFS and P3D produce almost equal tardiness.

Mode conversion theory has been applied to one-dimensional reflection in a time-varying inhomogeneous plasma, and numerical results have been obtained. Degenerate mode conversion, i.e. mode conversion between two eigenvectors of a plasma dispersion tensor with the same eigenvalues, can be analyzed using the same techniques as for nondegenerate mode conversion by adding several Maxwell two-fluid unknowns and equations into an initial description of the problem. This procedure has been applied to simple reflection in a slowly varying plasma with no magnetic field. Numerical methods permit evaluation of electric field in a time- and space-varying plasma without the use of mode-coupling theory. A finite-difference code was used to solve for field profiles in a one-dimensional gas cell with a slowly varying plasma density. Results have been obtained above and below the plasma critical density.

The effective integrations between power storage devices and conventional power sources have been developed and demonstrated for not only the mobile power management but also the stationary one. In this study, a power storage system is integrated into a high-efficient lean-burn gas engine in order to improve the operating stability at islanding operation by using the flexible power controllable capability of power storage system. We have designed and demonstrated the effective power control method of the power storage system to absorb the abrupt power change of a lean-burn gas engine, and to stabilize the operation when the load changes. This method provides the effective use of the limited capacity of the power storage system for the integration as well as the stable power supply by islanding operation.","2157-4839;21574839","978-1-4577-0545-8;9781457705458","","10.1109/APPEEC.2012.6307591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6307591","","Batteries;Delay;Engines;Power control;Power generation;Power supplies;Power system stability","energy storage;engines;power apparatus;power system control;power system management;power system stability","effective control method;lean-burn gas engine;mobile equipments;mobile power management;operating stability improvement;power sources;power storage devices;power storage system;power supply","","0","","7","","","27-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pierluigi and M. Andrea, 2002) (R. Silberglitt et al., 2002) . It is expected that the route length per MW demand of South Korea will decrease gradually from 0.57[C-km/MW] to 0.53[C-km/MW] in 2017 (2005). This comes up to a real serious problem from system planning and operation viewpoints. HTS technologies related to power system have properties to solve these complex transmission and distribution constraints, especially for metropolitan area, in the future. As the HTS technology has developed, the HTS cable technology can be the most effective alternative to solve the future expected power network constraints. This paper describes the application methodology of developing 22.9 kV HTS cable by CAST (the Center for Applied Superconductivity Technology) for practical distribution system. 22.9 kV HTS cable under development with step-by-step application methodology can substitute the existing and planning conventional 154 kV cable (2002) (2003). If this scheme is applied, part of downtown 154 kV substation of metropolitan city such as Seoul can be changed into 22.9 kV switching station. Additionally, it can give huge economic, environmental benefits to all of the concerned authorities.","1051-8223;10518223","","","10.1109/TASC.2007.898386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4277832","Application methodology;HTS cable;distribution system;metropolitan city","Cities and towns;Electricity supply industry deregulation;High temperature superconductors;Investments;Power cables;Power industry;Power system planning;Superconducting cables;Superconductivity;Urban areas","electricity supply industry deregulation;high-temperature superconductors;power cables;power distribution planning;power transmission planning;superconducting cables","CAST;Center for Applied Superconductivity Technology;HTS cable;South Korea Metropolitan City;distribution system operators;electricity demand;operation viewpoints;power industry deregulation;power network constraints;substation;system planning;transmission system operators;voltage 22.9 kV","","9","","6","","","June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The receiver uses a multistage constant modulus (CM) array for multiuser detection. It consists of several identical stages connected in a cascade structure. Each stage is composed of a CM array that captures one of the source signals, and an adaptive signal canceller that removes the source from the array input. Since the captured signal is corrupted by fading, Doppler shift and noise after each stage, it needs to be equalized in order to recover the original signal. Since CMA is phase blind, the output constellation of the algorithm has a phase error. A modified CMA that accomplishes blind equalization and carrier offset is proposed. In this paper the performance of MCMA-IMCMA for recovering the phase and carrier offset of the captured signals is evaluated. In order to speed up the steady state performance, once the error is in a so-called confidence zone the algorithm can switch between MCMA-IMCMA and a decision directed (DD) algorithm.

Nonplanar distortions of octahedra have been calculated for perovskite structures contained within the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. We find that antiferroelectric materials have buckling angles larger than ~2° and ferroelectric materials have buckling angles between 0° and 1°. The trend is found as a function of solid solution composition and temperature for common antiferroelectrics. For example, the described method resolves a structural difference between the end members PbTiO<sub>3</sub> and PbZrO<sub>3</sub>, which exhibit ferroelectric and antiferroelectric responses, respectively.

Through a bibliographical study and a modeling approach of the interruption arc, an analysis of the role of the different mechanisms of energy transfer between the arc and SF/sub 6/ was conducted. With a 10 kA pulse, about 80% of the transfer is found to be due to convection and the rest to radiation from the arc. This transfer results in an overpressure of nearly 1 bar in SF/sub 6/ and 2 bar in N/sub 2/. It appears that the operation of this type of circuit breaker is limited to high currents: for currents below 7 kA the overpressure is lower than 0.5 bar, which does not provide efficient blowing at current zero.<<ETX>>","0093-3813;00933813","","","10.1109/27.16548","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=16548","","Circuit breakers;Current measurement;Electric variables measurement;Energy exchange;Energy measurement;Equations;Physics;Pistons;Temperature;Voltage","circuit-breaking arcs","0 to 2 bar;10 KA;N/sub 2/;SF/sub 6/;arc voltage;blowing;circuit-breaker arc;convection;current;electric field;energy transfer;high-current phase;interruption arc;overpressure;pressure rise;pressure variations;self-generated flow","","5","","21","","","Dec. 1988","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"On taking advantage of similarities between parameters in lossless sequential coding","J. Aberg","Dept. of Inf. Technol., Lund Univ., Sweden","Data Compression Conference, 1999. Proceedings. DCC '99","20020806","1999","","","513","","Summary form only given. In sequential lossless data compression algorithms the data stream is often transformed into short subsequences that are modeled as memoryless. Then it is desirable to use any information that each sequence might provide about the behaviour of other sequences that can be expected to have similar properties. Here we examine one such situation, as follows. We want to encode, using arithmetic coding with a sequential estimator, an M-ary memoryless source with unknown parameters θ, from which we have encoded already a sequence x<sup>n</sup>. In addition, both the encoder and the decoder have observed a sequence y<sup>n</sup> that is generated independently by another source with unknown parameters θ˜ that are known to be “similar” to θ by a pseudodistance δ(θ,θ˜) that is approximately equal to the relative entropy. Known to both sides is also a number d such that δ(θ,θ˜)&les;d. For a stand-alone memoryless source, the worst-case average redundancy of the (n+1)-th encoding is lower bounded by 0.5(M-1)/n+O(1/n<sup>2</sup>), and the Dirichlet estimator is close to optimal for this case. We show that this bound holds also for the case with side information as described above, meaning that we can improve, at best, the O(1/n<sup>2</sup>)-term. We define a frequency weighted estimator for this. Application of the frequency weighted estimator to to the PPM algorithm (Bell et al., 1989) by weighting order-4 statistics into an order-5 model, with d estimated during encoding, yields improvements that are consistent with the bounds above, which means that in practice we improve the performance by about 0.5 bits per active state of the model, making a gain of approximately 20000 bits on the Calgary Corpus","1068-0314;10680314","0-7695-0096-X;076950096X","","10.1109/DCC.1999.785670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=785670","","Arithmetic;Data compression;Decoding;Encoding;Entropy;Frequency estimation;Performance gain;State estimation;Statistics;Yield estimation","arithmetic codes;data compression;redundancy;sequential estimation","Calgary Corpus;Dirichlet estimator;M-ary memoryless source;arithmetic coding;decoder;encoder;frequency weighted estimator;lossless data compression algorithms;lossless sequential coding;pseudodistance;redundancy;relative entropy;side information;stand-alone memoryless source;worst-case average redundancy","","0","","2","","","29-31 Mar 1999","29 Mar 1999-31 Mar 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pulses of 50-ns-length and of 6-MeV electrons pass through a free electron laser (FEL) wiggler. A 300-W, 140-GHz extended interaction oscillator (EIO) supplies the seed signal for amplification in the wiggler. The electron beam is dumped and the microwave beam is quasi-optically transmitted 90 ft by six aluminum mirrors through an evacuated tube. Three of the mirrors are elliptical paraboloids and the others are flat. A seventh mirror is rotated into the microwave beam to divert it into a load tank. The transport vacuum vessel is a 20-in-diameter stainless steel tube with bellows and mirror boxes at each mirror. Two vacuums systems at each end of the transport tube allow a base pressure of 10<sup>-7</sup> torr to be attained by 7000 L/s of turbomolecular pumping.

A new family of converters is often presented detailing electrical performance, yet discounting a cost evaluation of the topology; this paper attempts to address this issue. Detailed is an overview of two such topologies based upon a Boost Converter, for Input Current Shaping, ICS, and a Forward Converter for output regulation. The paper outlines essential design equations for the Single-Stage approach, discussing issues of importance and predicted behavior of such a design. The focus then moves onto measured operational performances of two 170W prototype PFC rectifiers, a Two-Stage and a Single-Stage respectively. Results obtained display comparable electrical performance, both in their abilities to limit input current harmonics and regulate the output voltage. However, a cost analysis that was performed indicated that monetary savings with the Single-Stage variants are not as significant as one would first expect. The unexpectedly small savings are a combination of the requirement for components with ratings that can withstand the stresses applied to them, and current market trends.","2164-5256;21645256","0-7803-9296-5;0780392965","","10.1109/PEDS.2005.1619811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1619811","cost and performance comparison;integrated magnetics;single-stage power factor correction","Costs;Displays;Equations;Motion measurement;Performance evaluation;Power factor correction;Prototypes;Rectifiers;Topology;Voltage","","cost and performance comparison;integrated magnetics;single-stage power factor correction","","3","","11","","","28-01 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collective I/O follows two-phase I/O scheme that consists of a data exchange phase and an I/O phase. The previous studies of collective I/O were usually related with improving the performance of each phase. Especially, Heuristic Node Reordering (HNR) is the technique to improve the data exchange performance where a different number of cores per node are used for a parallel application. In this study, we implement the HNR simulator and analyze the effectiveness of HNR under various cases. As a result, we find out the number of nodes, the maximum number of cores and the shape of I/O data array are the important factors related to improving the HNR performance.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176232","Collective I/O;I/O Aggregator;MPI-IO;Parallel I/O;Two-phase I/O","Arrays;Computational modeling;Data models;Degradation;Multicore processing;Shape;Simulation","message passing;parallel processing","HNR simulator;I/O data array;data exchange phase;heuristic node reordering;parallel computing systems;single file based parallel I/O","","0","","18","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore MARDO could adjust itself to fit the new demand when the requirement is modified.

Geo-n is very resilient to outliers and to a wide range of geometrical constellations of the nodes. Geo-n uses a two stage filtering technique to obtain the most representative intersection points between every pair of circles induced by anchor coordinates and distance measurements and uses these to estimate the position of unlocalized nodes. If no intersection exists between two circles, Geo-n approximates one to further improve localization accuracy. We compare Geo-n to LLS, NLLS, AML, Min-Max, and ICLA using simulations and real world experiments, and show analysis of the spatial distribution of position errors. Results demonstrate that Geo-n outperforms the other algorithms. Like NLLS, its spatial error distribution is very homogeneous.

However, most of existing CSS approaches will cause high computation costs for signal recovery when spectrum bandwidth goes large. As a result, it prolongs time for spectrum detection, which however runs counter to the original purpose of finding out spectrum opportunities over a wideband as rapidly as possible. To reduce the time consumed in signal reconstruction and realize real- time detection, we propose a novel decomposition compressed spectrum sensing (D-CSS) scheme. In D- CSS, a sparse sampling matrix is constructed first, and then it equivalently means a decomposition of the reconstructing process into two recovery subtasks. In doing so, we can scale down the overall problem and reduce the entire time for wideband spectrum detection compared with current CSS methods for a given desired sensing accuracy. Furthermore, the sparse character of our designed sampling matrix not only facilitates the operations of signal sampling and signal recovery, but also relieves the burden on random seeds generator and memory storage, which alleviates the overall implementation cost in CR practice.","1550-2252;15502252","","","10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7146135","","Cascading style sheets;Matrix decomposition;Radio frequency;Sensors;Signal to noise ratio;Sparse matrices;Wideband","compressed sensing;matrix algebra;radio spectrum management;signal detection;signal reconstruction","D-CSS scheme;compressive sampling;decomposition compressed spectrum sensing scheme;signal reconstruction;signal recovery;signal sampling;sparse sampling matrix;spectrum bandwidth;wideband spectrum detection;wideband spectrum sensing","","0","","9","","","11-14 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results have demonstrated that the electrical stability and field emission enhancement of CNT emitters are effectively achieved by the SCCO<inf>2</inf>fluids treatment compared to the heating process, due to the minimization of residuary moisture in CNTs.","2159-3523;21593523","0-7803-9357-0;0780393570","","10.1109/NANOEL.2006.1609754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609754","","Carbon dioxide;Carbon nanotubes;Cathodes;Degradation;Electron emission;Fabrication;Flat panel displays;Moisture;Solvents;Stability","","","","0","","17","","","10-13 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Recently, the Grey-World hypothesis and the max-RGB method were shown to be two instantiations of a Minkowski norm based color constancy method. Similarly we also propose a more general version of the Grey-Edge hypothesis which assumes that the Minkowsky norm of derivatives of the reflectance of surfaces is achromatic. The algorithms are tested on a large data set of images under different illuminants, and the results show that the new method outperforms the Grey-World assumption and the max-RGB method. Results are comparable to more elaborate algorithms, however at lower computational costs.","1522-4880;15224880","0-7803-9134-9;0780391349","","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530157","","Computational efficiency;Information systems;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent systems;Layout;Light sources;Reflectivity;Surface finishing;Surface waves;Testing","image colour analysis","Grey-edge hypothesis;Minkowsky norm of derivatives;color constancy;max-RGB method","","8","","7","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normally, in remote sensing a scene is represented by pixel-based features. It is possible to reduce data redundancy by a segmentfeature extraction process, where the segment-features, rather than the pixel-features, are used for multispectral scene representation and classification. Object-based algorithms partition the observation space into a set of disjoint segments (called objects). Then, pixels belonging to each segment are represented by segment features. In this paper, an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on statistical region merging (SRM) framework is presented. Also a partial differential equations (PDE) algorithm is suggested as a preprocessing phase to improve the segmentation results. Illustrative examples are presented, and the performance of the extracted object features for classification purposes is investigated.

This powerful instrument, which works at a science wavelength in the near-infrared, will enable the direct detection and characterization of self-luminous Jupiter-class planets from the ground. Semi-static and non-common path wave front errors that are not sensed by the active wave front sensor in the adaptive optics system will lead to a focal plane speckle pattern that will mask exo-planets. The GPI Instrument will incorporate an interferometric wave front sensor, designed and developed at JPL, which will measure these errors. This talk will emphasis this novel sensor and describes how it is used to measure the non-common path amplitude and phase errors in the system that would otherwise limit the achievable contrast. We will describe the system error budget as well as simulations that model the system performance.

Computational thinking is advocated as not only a fundamental skill or concept in computer science but also a core competency for all disciplines. Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving.","0190-5848;01905848","978-1-61284-468-8;9781612844688","978-1-61284-467-1;9781612844671","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142980","Computational Thinking;Computer Science Education;Problem Solving;Spreadsheet Functions","Computer science;Computers;Conferences;Educational institutions;Instruments;Problem-solving","computer science education;educational courses;further education;spreadsheet programs;statistical analysis;teaching","ANOVA;application;computational representation inadequate stipulation;computational thinking teaching;data type understanding;higher education;introductory MS Excel course;noncomputer science majors;noncomputing major college student;problem solving;productive representations;recall;spreadsheet functions;translation problem failure","","1","","9","","","12-15 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has led to a marked upturn in electricity wholesale prices, allowing generators to commit to considerable investment in their generating portfolio. Selecting a new control system for a 660MW generating unit in Europe's largest coal fired power station is not a decision taken lightly. Drax Power Limited have recently had to make this decision in order to help to ensure the security of their generation going forwards, in a continually evolving arena. The chosen system had to have a design life of twenty years and had to be flexible with sufficient expansion capacity to meet current and future environmental demands. The first system to be installed covers one of the three generating units with an I/O count of over 8000 points distributed across 17 dual redundant PLC nodes, communicating on a high speed Ethernet HIPER ring network, handling the real time continuous controls, plant sequencing, interlocking and alarm tagging. The system had to be installed and commissioned within a ten-week outage and it was essential that the unit return to service date was met. The perceived risk of not meeting this requirement was one of the key factors in the choice of the new system and was based on the chosen technology, the commitment and support from the vendor and the capability, commitment and support from the systems integrator. The success of this decision was only achieved by partnership and co-operation between all parties involved in the project.","","0-86341-728-0;0863417280","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126710","","","local area networks;nuclear power stations;power station control;power system security","Ethernet HIPER ring network;alarm tagging;continuous control;control system upgrade;drax power station;electricity wholesale prices;gas market;nuclear stations;plant sequencing;power station generation;supply security;team work","","0","","","","","28-28 Nov. 2006","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

HPPB. 5th International Conference on","20130107","1983","","","476","480","The UCI High Current Betatron has a uniform toroidal magnetic field in addition to the betatron field. Electrons are injected continuously from a thermionic emitter while both the toroidal and the betatron fields are rising. Electron capture takes place when more than 3 A is emitted from the injector either tangentially or non-directionally. Acceleration continues under a condition that the ratio between the average betatron field inside the orbit and the betatron field at the orbit is in the range of 1.2 – 3. At the initial phase of acceleration, the beam current increases rapidly with time. Then the beam suffers a gradual loss. Finally the whole beam disrupts and generates a burst of X-rays. If the injection is stopped in the middle of the course of the acceleration, the disruption of the beam happens at that moment. Influence of the space charge on the beam behavior is evident. The life of the beam becomes shorter as the injection current is reduced down to the threshold. The final electron momentum p inferred from X-ray measurement is related to the betatron field B and the major radius R by p ≈ 0.5 eBR, instead of p eBR. The beam current and electron energy increase with the increase of the injection voltage. Beam current of 150 A and electron energy of 500 keV are obtained at an injection voltage of 30 kV.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6403697","","","","","","0","","","","","12-14 Sept. 1983","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the photographer takes a burst of images, a modality available in virtually all modern digital cameras, we show that it is possible to combine them to get a clean sharp version. This is done without explicitly solving any blur estimation and subsequent inverse problem. The proposed algorithm is strikingly simple: it performs a weighted average in the Fourier domain, with weights depending on the Fourier spectrum magnitude. The method's rationale is that camera shake has a random nature and therefore each image in the burst is generally blurred differently. Experiments with real camera data show that the proposed Fourier Burst Accumulation algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results an order of magnitude faster, with simplicity for on-board implementation on camera phones.","1063-6919;10636919","","","10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298852","","Cameras;Deconvolution;Estimation;Kernel;Noise;Photonics","Fourier transforms;image restoration","Fourier burst accumulation algorithm;Fourier spectrum magnitude;burst deblurring;camera shake removal","","1","","","","","7-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since relationship between applied voltage and displacement cause by the voltage shows a hysteresis loop in the bimorph piezoelectric element used as components of the two-axial actuator, we produce a control system for the two-axial actuator based on a multi-layered artificial neural network to compensate the hysteresis. The neural network is comprised of 4 neurons in the input layer, 10 neurons in the hidden layer and ones neuron in the output layer. The output neuron emits time derivative of voltage; two bits signal expressing increment or decrement condition is generated by two input neurons; one of the other two input neurons and the other calculate current values of voltage and displacement, respectively. In the learning process, the network learns the hysteresis including minor loops. In the verification test, the endpoint of the two-axial actuator traces the desired circular trajectory in the two-dimensional coordinate system.

A microgrid is not a robust system when compared to a power system. Therefore, proper control strategies should be implemented for a successful operation of a microgrid. This paper proposes the use of a coordinated control of reactive sources for the improvement of the dynamic voltage stability in a microgrid. The associated controller is termed as a Micro Grid Voltage Stabilizer (MGVS). The MGVS is a secondary level voltage controller which takes the weighted average of the voltage deficiencies at the load Buses and generates a control signal. This control signal is divided among the reactive power sources in the microgrid in proportion to their available capacities; thus each source will be required to generate certain amount of reactive power.

It is well-known that the Q's of the AlN Lamb wave resonators are degraded due to energy dissipation through the support tethers. In this work, similar to the beveled edges used in AT-cut quartz resonators, the chamfered corners are utilized to trap vibration energy in the AlN plate to enhance the anchor Q's. Based on finite element analysis (FEA) simulated results, the AlN plate with chamfered corners can efficiently reduce mechanical vibrations in support tethers and trap more mechanical energy in the plate. The experimental results demonstrate that the loaded Q of the Lamb wave resonator is boosted from 2,041 to 3,016 and the minimum impedance is reduced from 87.4 O to 61.6 O by simply chamfering the AlN rectangular plate, showing a 1.48× increase in measured Q's.","","","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7329392","AlN;Lamb wave resonators;aluminum nitride;anchor loss;chamfered plate;finite element analysis;perfectly matched layer;quality factor","Aluminum nitride;Couplings;Damping;Frequency measurement;III-V semiconductor materials;Resonant frequency;Substrates","Q-factor measurement;aluminium compounds;finite element analysis;plates (structures);surface acoustic wave resonators;vibrations","AT-cut quartz resonator;AlN;FEA;chamfered corner;chamfered plate;energy dissipation;finite element analysis;mechanical energy traping;mechanical vibration reduction;piezoelectric Lamb wave resonator;quality factor;tether","","","","23","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the elevator speed was 300 rpm, the yield was the most stable and its coefficient of variation (CV for short) was the lowest one: 3.66%.

However, there is a drawback of MAVs - its limited payload and size don't allow adding extensive sensors. That explains why incorporating computer vision is of great significance to MAVs. One of the problems that computer-vision-driven MAVs need to overcome is obstacle avoidance, which is very important for autonomic vehicles especially for aerial vehicles as they are more vulnerable to collision compared to ground vehicles. Over the last ten years, several obstacle detection algorithms have been developed to create collision-free maneuver for MAVs. Most of them have promising results inside virtual environment; however, they fail miserably during actual flight tests. In this project, we will investigate the real-life issues affecting obstacle avoidance for MAVs and carry out the project on a physical drone. We take into consideration the limitations of the platform and derive our own obstacle avoidance algorithm by combining several existing ones. Effectiveness of the algorithm will be demonstrated through experimental results on the physical drone.","","","","10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064451","computer vision;drone;micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs);monocular;obstacle avoidance","Cameras;Classification algorithms;Collision avoidance;Computer vision;Image edge detection;Image motion analysis;Streaming media","autonomous aerial vehicles;collision avoidance;microrobots;mobile robots;robot vision;telerobotics","MAV;autonomic vehicles;microaerial vehicles;monocular computer vision;obstacle avoidance algorithm;physical drone","","0","","9","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evaluating the performance of resonant clocks, a statistical clock skew modeling for resonant clock distribution network is presented in this paper, supporting the design of low power, skew, and jitter resonant H-tree clock distribution networks. This paper applies the models to two case designs of a two-level resonant H-tree network and a two-level nonresonant H-tree network, distributing a 5-GHz clock signal in a 0.18-um CMOS technology. The Monte Carlo simulation results exhibits that a two-level resonant H-tree network can achieve an 64% decrease in clock skew and a 65% decrease in clock jitter as compared to a nonresonant H-tree clock distribution network. In the paper, the clock skews between leaf nodes hardly do not vary with the power supply noise for resonant clock is first found. Statistical jitter simulations also show that resonant clock distribution networks have optimal clock jitter with special load.","","978-1-4244-4886-9;9781424448869","978-1-4244-4888-3;9781424448883","10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5250335","","CMOS technology;Clocks;Frequency;Inductors;Jitter;Power supplies;Resonance;Semiconductor device modeling;Signal design;Spirals","CMOS digital integrated circuits;Monte Carlo methods;clocks;high-speed integrated circuits;low-power electronics","CMOS technology;Monte Carlo simulation;frequency 5 GHz;high frequency digital design;jitter resonant H-tree network;low-power design;resonant clock distribution network;size 0.18 mum;statistical clock skew modeling","","0","","5","","","23-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simultaneously the genetic operators are adaptively determined according to the population diversity and individual fitness.

Recent research has shown that super-resolved data can be reconstructed from an extremely small set of measurements compared to that currently required. Therefore, a CS to produce SAR super-resolution images is introduced in the present work. The proposed approach contributes in three ways. First, enhanced SR results are achieved using a framework that combines CS with a multi-dictionary. Then, the multi-dictionary pairs are trained after classifying the training images through a sparse coding spatial pyramid machine. Each dictionary pair containing low- and high-resolution dictionaries are jointly trained. Finally, the gradient-descent optimization approach is applied to decrease the mutual coherence between the measurement matrix and the representation basis. The CS reconstruction effect is related to incoherence. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on TerraSAR-X data.","1939-1404;19391404","","","10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2189555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187672","Compressed sensing (CS);measurement matrix;multi-dictionary;sparse representation;super-resolution (SR);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Strontium;Training;Vectors","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image reconstruction;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","SAR image reconstruction;SAR image super-resolution;TerraSAR-X data;compressed sensing theory framework;gradient-descent optimization approach;high-resolution dictionary;learning based compressed sensing;low-resolution dictionary;multidictionary pairs;sparse coding spatial pyramid machine;super-resolved data;synthetic aperture radar;training images","","8","","39","","2012-04-19","Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

During deicing periods, the ambient temperature is allowed to increase at different rates over the freezing range. Results show that, for each kind of insulator, there is a flashover threshold current, which is 120 mA for the long rod insulator tested, and 180 mA for the porcelain insulator. Thickness of ice accretion at which flashover occurs (flashover threshold thickness) is smaller, during icing period than during deicing periods. Hard rime, of 0.87 in density is the most dangerous kind of ice: white arc and flashover occurs at very low thickness of this ice.

So, although the paper discusses in some detail the value of improved performance and business merits of the distributed architecture, it primarily focuses on the economic value of distributed power. The paper demonstrates that not only can distributed power be cost competitive with other powering solutions, it may in fact hold a sizable cost advantage. Some of these advantages are derived from the pay-as-you-grow concept provided by the distributed power architecture.

Unfortunately, the coarse quantization of phase error makes these systems prone to the generation of limit cycles appearing as unwanted spurs in the spectrum. The random noise contributed by building blocks and acting as dithering signal can eliminate those spurs. The quantitative analysis of those phenomena becomes more involved when a DCO with relaxed intrinsic resolution, such as a ΔΣ-DCO is employed, and when practical spectra of random noise sources are considered. In this work, the expression of jitter is calculated in closed-form taking into account the quantization, introduced by both phase detector and DCO, and the phase noise of DCO, with both 1/f <sup>2</sup> and 1/f <sup>3</sup> components. Combining these results, a closed-form expression of the total output jitter as a function of loop parameters and noise sources is developed which suggests a minimum-jitter design strategy. The proposed analysis and optimization are validated both numerically and experimentally on a 320-MHz digital bang-bang PLL fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process.","1549-8328;15498328","","","10.1109/TCSI.2013.2268514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6552848","Clock generation;TDC-less;digital assistance;flicker;frequency synthesis;jitter;lead-lag control;phase noise;single-bit TDC","","CMOS integrated circuits;jitter;phase detectors;phase locked loops;phase noise;random noise","CMOS process;DCO;bang-bang phase detector;bang-bang phase-locked loops;coarse quantization;frequency 320 MHz;low-jitter clock-frequency multiplication;low-jitter digital phase-locked loops;minimum-jitter design;phase noise;random noise;size 65 nm","","12","","18","","2013-07-03","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes a novel methodology to obtain rotation and scale invariant texture features from the images. The feature extraction for a given image involves the calculation of the averages of Gabor filter responses at various scales and orientations. For rotation and scaling of images, these averages indicate the respective shifts in the features. These shifts are normalized by doing summations of Gabor responses across scales and then taking the magnitude of Discrete Fourier Transforms across the resulting features and vice versa thus giving us scale and rotation invariant texture features. The proposed features are used for identifying cancer in the vital stained magnification endoscopy images. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed feature set over several other state-of-the-art texture feature extraction methods with around 90% classification accuracy for identifying cancer in gastroenterology images.","1522-4880;15224880","","","10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738296","","","Gabor filters;cancer;computer vision;discrete Fourier transforms;endoscopes;feature extraction;image classification;image texture;medical image processing","DFT based rotation;Gabor filter;Gabor response;cancer identification;computer vision;discrete Fourier transform;feature extraction;gastroenterology images;scale invariant Gabor texture descriptor;stained magnification endoscopy images;texture image classification","","0","","9","","","15-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Generation of high-quality carrier waves for future high-bitrate THz links","S. Preussler; R. P. Braun; M. Grigat; T. Schneider","","Photonic Networks; 15. ITG Symposium; Proceedings of","20140624","2014","","","1","6","In commercial DWDM systems with channel bandwidths of 50 GHz, currently 100 Gbps can be transmitted. In order to transmit such high data rates via antennas, the radio wave needs a high carrier frequency in the millimeter or submillimeter and THz range. Due to the very high demands on the stability against fluctuating environmental conditions, the generation of such high carrier frequencies with exceptional quality (narrow linewidth, low phase noise, high stability of amplitude and frequency) at the transmitter or receiver is very difficult or impossible with existing technologies. A method for generating high-quality THz carrier waves is based on a highly accurate frequency comb generated by a femtosecond laser where all lines of the spectrum have the same phase relations. Subsequently, two frequency lines are separated by means of stimulated Brillouin scattering. This results in a fixed phase relationship between the two optical waves. These can be modulated arbitrarily and transported over the existing network infrastructure to the station with the corresponding photo mixer. First proof-of -concept experiments show a 100 GHz carrier wave with a phase noise of -104 dBc/Hz at a frequency offset of 10 kHz. The linewidth is found to be 1 Hz, due to the limiting measurement equipment. This contribution focuses on the different frequency comb sources as well as the different possibilities for the separation of the frequency lines and shows a practical realization for the generation of different carrier waves.","","978-3-8007-3604-1;9783800736041","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6839990","","","","","","0","","","","","5-6 May 2014","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

To overcome this deficiency, we propose an extension of context representation, classification, and inference. Our model relies on fuzzy set theory to accommodate the imperfect nature of sensed context. We develop two fuzzy inference engines dealing with context specialization and compatibility relations. We evaluate such engines through a series of experiments involving real users.

The confronted challenge is that the estimation problem exhibits nonlinear property and multiple local minima and the objective function surfers from measurement noise. To tackle this challenge, a novel parameter estimation technique based on a global direct search method, named Hyperbolic Cross Points (HCP) algorithm, is proposed. Accordingly, it is applied for the non-intrusive detection of stator winding short circuit fault in squirrel-cage induction machines. The simulated stator current used in testing HCP method is generated from a MATLAB/SIMULINK induction motor model. The algorithm has been validated by considering various stator short circuit levels and fault locations. After the algorithm has been carefully tested, it is used to estimate fault parameters from recorded current from a 800W squirrel-cage induction motor in the laboratory environment. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method by detecting both the fault location and short circuit level with high accuracy and reduced computational burden.","","","978-1-84919-743-4;9781849197434","10.1049/cp.2012.2150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615060","HCP algorithm;Induction machines;parameter estimation;sparse grid;stator fault diagnosis","","electric breakdown;fault location;induction motors;parameter estimation;search problems;squirrel cage motors","HCP algorithm;HCP method;MATLAB/SIMULINK induction motor model;asset condition monitoring;breakdown deterioration;direct search;fault locations;function surfers;hyperbolic cross points;induction machine stator fault diagnosis;multiple local minima;nonintrusive detection;nonlinear property;parameter estimation technique;power 800 W;sparse grid;squirrel-cage induction machines;squirrel-cage induction motor;stator short circuit levels;stator winding short circuit","","4","","","","","18-21 Nov. 2012","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In dynamic virtual organizations (VOs), we believe dynamic service hosting provides an important flexibility. Our model also defines several new adaptive grid service classes that support adaptation at multiple levels. Dynamic service deployment allows new services to be added or replaced without taking down a site for reconfiguration and allows a VO to respond effectively to dynamic resource availability and demand.

To address the problem, we propose a reliable point selection method to automatically evaluate the reliability of corresponding points obtained by optical flow. The gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) is applied to the texture-based correlation evaluation and those points whose correlation coefficients are lower than a threshold will be removed.

Proceedings of the Sixteenth National","20020806","1999","","","D8/1","D8/6","The separation of air flow inside the vocal tract has been noticed experimentally in many works. In this work, some sort of such separation can be computed numerically using a simplified linear form of Navier-Stokes equations inside the vocal tract. The simplified set of flow equations preserves both the linearity of simple models and viscous losses of the natural phonation process. These equations are solved within two contiguous domains based on the boundary-layer theorem for compressible, low density and low viscosity fluids. The solution within the bulk of the vocal tract is easily conducted using the reflection-type line analog model. The momentum equation is a second order linear partial differential equation since it contains the viscosity effect. This equation, is, then, solved within the boundary layer which is adjacent to the vocal tract walls with time varying boundary conditions. This solution gives the velocity distribution of fluid flow which exhibits a separation. This approach afford a simple and fast linear solution which elaborates such complex behavior of air flow inside the vocal tract","","977-5031-62-1;9775031621","","10.1109/NRSC.1999.760936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760936","","Boundary conditions;Differential equations;Fluid flow;Fluidics;Linearity;Lips;Navier-Stokes equations;Partial differential equations;Physics;Viscosity","Navier-Stokes equations;aeroacoustics;flow separation;partial differential equations;physiological models;pipe flow;speech;viscosity","Navier-Stokes equations;air flow separation;boundary-layer theorem;compressible fluids;fluid flow;low density fluids;low viscosity fluids;momentum equation;phonation;reflection-type line analog model;second order linear partial differential equation;time varying boundary conditions;velocity distribution;viscosity effect;viscous losses;vocal tract model","","0","","13","","","23-25 Feb 1999","23 Feb 1999-25 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key problem resulting from using static scheduling approaches for allocating VMs on different physical machines (PMs) is that resources tend to be not fully utilised. Although some existing cloud reconfiguration algorithms have been developed to address the problem, they normally result in high migration costs and low resource utilisation due to ignoring the multi-dimensional characteristics of VMs and PMs. In this paper we present and evaluate a new algorithm for improving resource utilisation for cloud providers. By using a multivariate probabilistic model, our algorithm selects suitable PMs for VM re-allocation which are then used to generate a reconfiguration plan. We also describe two heuristics metrics which can be used in the algorithm to capture the multi-dimensional characteristics of VMs and PMs. By combining these two heuristics metrics in our experiments, we observed that our approach improves the resource utilisation level by around 8% for cloud providers, such as IC Cloud, which accept user-defined VM configurations and 14% for providers, such as Amazon EC2, which only provide limited types of VM configurations.","2159-6182;21596182","978-1-4673-2892-0;9781467328920","","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253553","Algorithms;Cloud Computing;Heuristics;Resource Allocation;Resource Management","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Gaussian distribution;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Resource management;Vectors","cloud computing;probability;resource allocation;virtual machines","Amazon EC2;IC cloud;PM;VM;cloud computing environments;cloud environment;heuristics metrics;multivariate probabilistic models;physical machines;resource provisioning;resource utilisation;static scheduling approaches;virtual machine","","14","","27","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the bandwidth of channels differs from each other and users can join at any time to these multicast channels, they may experience a synchronization problem between download and playback. To deal with this issue, some schemes have been proposed, however, at the cost of additional or wastage of bandwidth or sudden extreme bandwidth requirement. In this paper we present an adaptive quasi harmonic broadcasting scheme (AQHB) which delivers all data segment on time that is the download and playback synchronization problem is eliminated while keeping the bandwidth consumption as same as traditional harmonic broadcasting scheme without cost of any additional or wastage of bandwidth. It also ensures the video server not to increase the channel bandwidth suddenly that is, also eliminates the sudden buffer requirement at the client side. We present several analytical results to exhibit the efficiency of our proposed broadcasting scheme over the existing ones.","","978-1-4799-0397-9;9781479903979","","10.1109/ICIEV.2013.6572684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6572684","VOD;download and playback synchronization;harmonic broadcasting;quasi harmonic broadcasting","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Harmonic analysis;Multimedia communication;Protocols;Streaming media;Synchronization","bandwidth allocation;channel allocation;digital video broadcasting;protocols;synchronisation;video on demand;video servers","AQHB;adaptive quasiharmonic broadcasting scheme;channel bandwidth assignment;multicast channels;optimal bandwidth requirement;playback synchronization;video server;video-on-demand service","","1","","12","","","17-18 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While shear velocity measurement based on acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging produces reliable results in homogeneous media, it is still a challenge to accurately detect the shear wave propagation velocity in heterogeneous tissue. The reflection of the shear wave in heterogeneous media can severely alter the displacement temporal profile shape from location to location and makes detection methods perform poorly when estimating shear wave propagation time. In this work a parametric model was developed to minimize the affect of altered displacement profile on the estimate. The new method uses shear velocities between the excitation and detection spaces as model parameters and uses the normalized displacement temporal profiles at detection locations as probability distribution functions. A joint density (likelihood) function is then constructed based on the shear velocities and the displacement profiles. Searching for the maximum value of the likelihood function by using an iterative method produces estimates of the shear velocity which are more robust to shear wave reflections.","1051-0117;10510117","978-1-4577-1253-1;9781457712531","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2011.0314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6293216","ARFI;MLE;shear wave;tissue elasticity","Acoustics;Elasticity;Maximum likelihood estimation;Phantoms;Reflection;Ultrasonic imaging","acoustic imaging;acoustic wave propagation;acoustic wave reflection;acoustic wave velocity measurement;bioacoustics;biological tissues;elastic waves;maximum likelihood estimation;probability","acoustic radiation force impulse imaging;displacement temporal profile shape;heterogeneous tissue;joint density function;maximum likelihood estimation;probability distribution functions;shear velocity measurement;shear wave propagation speed;shear wave reflection","","0","","11","","","18-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In deregulated environment, the generation companies (GENCOs) schedule their generators to maximize their profit rather than satisfying the power demand. While solving the PBUC problem, the information of forecasted price at the given predicted power demand is known. The PBUC problem is solved by the proposed approach in two stages. Initially, committed units table obtains information of the committed units and finally the non linear programming sub problem of economic dispatch is solved by Muller method. The proposed approach has been tested on a power system with 3 and 10 generating units. Simulation results of the proposed approach have been compared with existing methods and also with the traditional unit commitment. It is observed from the simulation results that the proposed algorithm provides maximum profit with less computational time compare to existing methods.","1932-5517;19325517","978-1-4244-1905-0;9781424419050","978-1-4244-1906-7;9781424419067","10.1109/PES.2008.4596653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4596653","Muller method and Deregulation;Profit based unit commitment;committed units table","Computational modeling;Demand forecasting;Economic forecasting;Environmental economics;Linear programming;Power demand;Power generation;Power generation economics;Power system economics;Power system simulation","power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling","GENCO;Muller method;PBUC problem;deregulated environment;economic dispatch;generation companies;maximum profit algorithm;nonlinear programming subproblem;power demand;power system;price forecasting;profit based unit commitment","","1","","9","","","20-24 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VLSI design with SIMS makes it possible to consider parasitic effects fast and accurately, which becomes more important in deep submicron circuit design.

To handle appearance change due to potentially large aspect angle variations, a homography-based view synthesis method is then used to generate a novel view of each image in the exemplar database at the same pose as the testing object in each frame of a testing video segment. A rotationally invariant color matcher and a spatial-feature matcher based on distance transforms are combined using a weighted average rule to compare the novel view and the testing object. After looping over all testing frames, the set of match scores is passed to a temporal analysis module to examine the behavior of the testing object, and calculate a final likelihood.

VoIP has been identified as a critical real-time application in the network QoS research community and has been implemented in commercial products. To provide competent quality of service for VoIP, the call admission control (CAC) mechanism has to be introduced to prevent packet losing and over-queuing. Several well-designed CAC mechanisms, such as the Site- Utilization-Based CAC and the link-utilization-based CAC mechanisms, are in place. However, the existing commercial VoIP systems have not been able to adequately apply and support these CAC mechanisms, and hence unable to provide QoS guarantees to VoIP. We have designed and implemented a QoS-Provisioning system that can be seamlessly integrated to the existing VoIP system to overcome its weakness in offering QoS guarantees. As a result, our system has been realized at Internet2 Voice Over IP Testbed in Texas A&M University.","1545-3421;15453421","0-7695-1739-0;0769517390","","10.1109/RTTAS.2002.1137402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1137402","","Admission control;Call admission control;Communication system traffic control;Delay;IP networks;Internet telephony;Packet switching;Quality of service;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","Internet telephony;packet switching;quality of service;telecommunication congestion control","Internet2 Voice Over IP Testbed;QoS-provisioning system;VoIP;call admission control;link utilization-based CAC mechanisms;network QoS research community;packet switching networks;quality of service;voice over IP","","1","","11","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new normalized coefficient, which measures the degree of match between two multivalued vectors, termed the vector degree of match (VDM), provides the SLRG applications with the metric needed to group adjacent pixel pairs. Two new SLRG algorithms, applied to multiband images and exploiting the VDM criterion, are presented. Their major advantage, in comparison with the SLRG implementations found in the literature, is that they required only one user-defined parameter, the VDM Threshold (VDMT), which is a normalized value featuring local adaptivity and having an intuitive physical meaning. The use of an SLRG module is convenient as the first stage of a structured segmentation procedure featuring the following functional properties: (i) it is implemented sequentially; (ii) it combines single linkage, centroid linkage and hybrid linkage criteria; and (iii) its goal is the detection of image areas characterized by low contrast","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/36.481899","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=481899","","Couplings;Filters;Humans;Image processing;Image segmentation;Information processing;Merging;Pixel;Robustness;Visual system","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;image segmentation;optical information processing;remote sensing","geophysical measurement technique;hybrid linkage criteria;image classification;image processing;image segmentation;land surface;matching;merging;multivalued vector;neighboring pixel;optical imaging;remote sensing;single linkage region growing algorithm;terrain mapping;vector degree of match","","9","1","32","","","Jan 1996","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We only consider techniques that offer a lossless compression: that is, where the entire graph can still be read from the compressed version. The techniques considered are: a simple grouping of nodes with identical neighbor sets; Modular Decomposition which permits internal structure in modules and allows them to be nested; and Power Graph Analysis which further allows edges to cross module boundaries. These techniques all have the same goal-to compress the set of edges that need to be rendered to fully convey connectivity-but each successive relaxation of the module definition permits fewer edges to be drawn in the rendered graph. Each successive technique also, we hypothesize, requires a higher degree of mental effort to interpret. We test this hypothetical trade-off with two studies involving human participants. For Power Graph Analysis we propose a novel optimal technique based on constraint programming. This enables us to explore the parameter space for the technique more precisely than could be achieved with a heuristic. Although applicable to many domains, we are motivated by-and discuss in particular-the application to software dependency analysis.","1077-2626;10772626","","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634098","Computer graphics;Directed graphs;Edge detection;Modular construction;modular decomposition;networks;power graph analysis","Computer graphics;Edge detection;Modular construction","constraint handling;data compression;directed graphs","aggregate connectivity;constraint programming;dense directed graph visualisation;edge compression techniques;lossless compression;modular decomposition;power graph analysis;software dependency analysis","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Data Compression;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface","5","","25","","","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Both queries and profiles are defined as subspaces of a multi-dimensional content space. Matched objects may be downloaded or synchronized. We present a generic data structure with optimizations for matching in this environment and discuss several use cases where the system may be applied.

The power consumed by these circuits has a main component (dynamic power) that is proportional to the square of the supply voltage. Additionally, for every supply voltage, there is a maximum value of the clock frequency. The advantage of using DVS is that the supply voltage (and hence clock frequency) can be adjusted depending on the specific needs during execution. The DVS concept has been used in some commercial products like TransmetaÂ¿s Crusoe [1], Intel Speed Step [2], AMD K6 [3], Hitachi SH4 [4], etc. The DVS algorithm proposed in this work is based on the trade-off between the applicationÂ¿s execution time and the energy consumed by the microprocessor. Indirectly, by controlling the execution time the consumed energy is controlled as well. Longer execution time provides less energy demanded by the CPU. The algorithm has been implemented on a platform with an Intel XScale PXA255 microprocessor and the energy saving has been calculated directly measuring currents and voltages on the platform. Using this technique it is possible to achieve up to 50% of power savings, with 50% longer execution time.","","978-3-8007-3089-6;9783800730896","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5755728","","Clocks;Energy measurement;Frequency estimation;Microprocessors;Power demand;Time frequency analysis;Voltage control","","","","0","","","","","11-13 March 2008","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

They aim at providing multichannel radiances within the spectral range of visible to infrared (IR) wavelengths for many environmental applications, including data assimilation and retrievals of global atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. However, the velocity of the filter wheel of the first IRAS onboard FY3A is unstable and, therefore, induced a discontinuity in the measurement. The IRAS onboard FY3B works well in normal and stable operational mode since its launch without any anomaly. A variety of postlaunch calibration/validation tasks are conducted using on-orbit data during a period of three months. This paper presents on-orbit verification of IRAS instrument performance, including long-term trends of the space and warm calibration counts and noise equivalent delta radiance. The Earth scenes observed simultaneously by IRAS and Meteorological Operational Satellite Programme (METOP)/Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer were obtained and compared to demonstrate a close similarity between the two measurements. Furthermore, the IR channel observations from FY3B/IRAS are compared with those from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-19/High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) equivalent channels and simulations from a radiative transfer model. The results show that some of IRAS IR channels perform very well, particularly for channels 1-10, 15, 19, and 20, compared to those of HIRS. Several channels, such as 13, 16, and 18, however, display some large biases. The causes of these increased biases are still under investigation.","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2204268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272342","Calibration validation;FengYun 3;InfraRed Atmospheric Sounder (IRAS);on-orbit calibration","Atmospheric measurements;Calibration;Instruments;Noise;Satellites;Temperature measurement","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric temperature;calibration;data assimilation","AD 2008 05 27;AD 2010 11 05;FY3B satellite;FengYun-3A satellite;FengYun-3B satellite;High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder;IR channel observations;IRAS IR channels;IRAS instruments;Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer;Meteorological Operational Satellite Programme;National Atmospheric Administration;National Oceanic Administration;data assimilation;environmental applications;filter wheel velocity;global atmospheric humidity profile;global atmospheric temperature profile;infrared wavelength;on-orbit data;postlaunch calibration task;postlaunch validation task;radiative transfer model;space calibration count;visible wavelength;warm calibration count","","0","","16","","2012-08-17","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At first step, a sliding mode-plus-PI controller is designed for prediction of the stator current reference signal. The proposed position controller is fast response and robust against mechanical parameter uncertainties and load torque disturbance. At Second step, the proposed sliding mode based AIOFL controller estimates the unknown electrical uncertainties without using sign(.) or sat(.) function. Hence, it reduces chattering or steady state error phenomenon. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control approach is demonstrated by computer simulation.

The features are used to train a linear SVM classifier to identify morphological changes in a dataset of zebrafish embryo images. Results show that proposed gCo-HOG based technique clearly outperforms HOG and Co-HOG features. The importance of descriptor lies in the fact that features are discriminative enough to capture subtle morphological changes between normal anatomy and toxin induced changes.","1945-7928;19457928","","","10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163926","","Embryo;Feature extraction;Head;Histograms;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Shape","blood vessels;medical image processing;support vector machines;toxicology","caudal vein structural change analysis;gradient weighted CO-HOG;gradient weighted co-occurrence histogram of oriented gradients;linear SVM classifier;morphological change analysis;spatial distribution;toxin exposure;vascular development;zebrafish embryo","","0","","16","","","16-19 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By explicitly incorporating the efficiency functions and input constraints of in-wheel motors in the low-level A-EECA design, virtual control signals from the high-level dynamic SMC are distributed to four actuators with an adaptive convergence to the energy-optimal operating points. Taking allocation errors between the virtual control efforts and the real actuation realizations as inputs, the input-to-state stability of the overall feedback system is proved.

In spite of the growing popularity of such grids, the service discovery, although efficient in many cases, does not reach several requirements. Among them, the flexibility of the discovery and its efficiency on wide-area dynamic platforms are two major issues. Therefore, it becomes crucial to propose new tools coping with such platforms. Emerging peer-to-peer technologies provide algorithms allowing the distribution and the retrieval of data items while addressing the dynamicity of the underlying network. We study in this paper the service discovery in a pure peer-to-peer environment. We describe a new trie-based approach for the service discovery that supports range queries and automatic completion of partial search strings, while providing fault-tolerance, and partially taking into account the topology of the underlying network. We validate this approach both by analysis and simulation. Traditional metrics considered in peer-to-peer systems exhibits interesting complexities within our architecture.

First, we briefly introduce the motivation for handling permanent and transient faults within a combined architecture. Then, based on the well known TMR scheme, we present the difference in modeling the reliability for permanent and transient faults. Subsequently, we introduce two distinct methods for modeling both fault types together and explain how the calculation of the reliability can be done. Both models vary in their accuracy and complexity. Furthermore, we apply the proposed modeling strategies to a more complex system, where permanent fault compensation is used to keep transient fault detection/masking unaffected. Modeling this system with both methods is discussed for varying system parameters and failure rates. The results show that in particular situations the use of the simple model is sufficient and makes system modeling less time consuming. But in some cases the inaccuracy of the simplified model will cause an excessively optimistic estimation of the reliability.","1736-3705;17363705","","","10.1109/BEC.2014.7320559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320559","","Hardware;Redundancy;Tunneling magnetoresistance","CMOS integrated circuits;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit reliability;transient analysis","CMOS;TMR scheme;complementary metal oxide semiconductor;fault compensation;fault detection;fault masking;permanent fault handling;reliability estimation;transient fault","","","","8","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, a huge amount of traffic is transferred within backbone networks; therefore reducing P2P traffic is important for transit ISPs to improve the efficiency of network resource usage and reduce network capital cost. To reduce P2P traffic, it is effective for ISPs to implement cache devices at some router ports and reduce the hop length of P2P flows by delivering the required content from caches. However, the design problem of cache locations and capacities has not been well investigated, although the effect of caches strongly depends on the cache locations and capacities. We propose an optimum design method of cache capacity and location for minimizing the total amount of P2P traffic based on dynamic programming, assuming that transit ISPs provide caches at transit links to access ISP networks. We apply the proposed design method to 31 actual ISP backbone networks.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501837","","Communications Society;Costs;Design methodology;Dynamic programming;IP networks;Laboratories;Peer to peer computing;Spine;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","ISP networks;Internet;P2P traffic reduction;backbone networks;cache capacity;dynamic programming;network resource usage","","2","","26","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To understand the light induced degradation phenomena, the generation process of interstitial impurities induced by light irradiation is theoretically studied by using ab initio molecular-orbital calculations. The impurities at substitutional sites are stable, and they do not move to the interstitial sites even by the presence of excess electrons. However, when there are interstitial Si atoms near the substitutional impurities, such as B and C, these impurities easily become to the interstitial ones through the kick-out process. This reaction is enhanced by the injection of excess electrons. On the other hand, it is difficult to generate the interstitial Ga even with the interstitial Si and electron injection. This is the reason why B doped Cz-Si is degraded by the light irradiation, while Ga doped wafer is robust for the light induced degradation.","","4-9901816-0-3;4990181603","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1305233","","","ab initio calculations;boron;charge injection;elemental semiconductors;interstitials;orbital calculations;radiation effects;silicon;solar cells","B-doped Cz-Si;Si:B;ab initio molecular-orbital calculation;electron injection;excess electron;interstitial impurities;interstitial site;kick-out process;light irradiation;solar cell conversion efficiency;solar cell material;substitutional impurities;substitutional site","","0","","9","","","18-18 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Parameters and parameter changes at current, voltage and generated power in PV system acquired from the system and these parameters were monitored in real time thanks to Labview DAQ card. Output voltage, output current and power generated from the PV system were also monitored with developed Labview software. All the experimental results obtained from the PV power generation system were explained detailed in the paper.

However, when the initial configuration of the robot is far from the reference path, the stabilization process may involve an important transition phase before the robot moves along the path. Though it is possible to guarantee that the robot will not collide with obstacles as it moves closely along the path, it is hard to insure the motion to be safe during the transition phase. The paper presents a path following controller for mobile robots, allowing it to avoid obstacles during the transition phase. The control design is based on sliding mode techniques. We define a time-varying sliding manifold and we use this degree of freedom to modify the shape of the robot's trajectory, during the path-following process.

A simple design method results by designing the pre-filter stage coefficients via a differential coding scheme. The IIR stage is then simply a linear predictor reconstruction stage. The differential coding method eliminates the redundancies of the filter coefficient sequence and makes it possible to quantize the coefficients into a few levels. A linear prediction algorithm is applied to optimize the differential coding method using the statistical characteristics of the given filter. Relatively wideband filters as well as narrowband filters have been sucessfully designed without interpolating the original filters. Overall design procedures and design examples for a variety of filters are included, and the theoretical aspects of this approach are studied.","","","","10.1109/ICASSP.1985.1168431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1168431","","Band pass filters;Bandwidth;Design methodology;Equations;Finite impulse response filter;Interpolation;Narrowband;Nonlinear filters;Prediction algorithms;Transversal filters","","","","1","","7","","","Apr 1985","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technique was used in order to obtain the far-field or induced current of antenna or scattering problems. Little has been done or published on adaptive frequency sampling, i.e. an algorithm for selecting additional frequencies in regions where the approximation exceeds some error measure, and for maximising the information provided by each new sample point.

Our approaches are ideal for exchanging control information in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) and wireless mesh networks so that dynamic resource needs of participating nodes can be rapidly accommodated for quality of service (QoS) guarantees. The two algorithms, network entry based scheduling (NEBS) and virtual slot scheduling (VSLOT), described in this paper allow the exchange of control information in an efficient and contention free manner such that each participating node can, in real time, converge to a consistent TDMA schedule that is optimum for the topology and resource demand of a dynamic wireless network environment. The algorithms are topology independent and only require one and two hop information to create both fair and efficient TDMA schedules that dynamically adapt to changing wireless network topologies.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-2676-8;9781424426768","978-1-4244-2677-5;9781424426775","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753580","","Access protocols;Bandwidth;Dynamic scheduling;Media Access Protocol;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Quality of service;Scheduling algorithm;Time division multiple access;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;quality of service;scheduling;telecommunication network topology;time division multiple access","MANET;QoS;TDMA based mobile ad hoc network;control information exchange;dynamic contention free time division multiple access;dynamic control slot scheduling algorithm;network entry based scheduling;network topology;quality of service;resource demand;virtual slot scheduling;wireless mesh network","","2","3","9","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Schmieg","DIgSILENT GmbH, Germany","Industrial &amp; Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference, 1999 IEEE.","20020806","1999","","","5 pp.","","The field of power system reliability is dominated by the use of homogeneous Markov models. The negative exponential distributions in these models, however, are unrealistic in the case of repair or switching times. The use of homogeneous Markov models is often justified by arguing that the use of other models makes it impossible to perform analytical or nonsequential calculations. A special kind of semi-Markov model is proposed which uses Weibull-distributions for all stochastic durations. The proposed model encloses the homogeneous Markov model as a subset, enables bell-shaped duration distributions and may be used in various analytical and nonsequential reliability assessment methods","","0-7803-5593-8;0780355938","","10.1109/ICPS.1999.787215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=787215","","Exponential distribution;Failure analysis;Mathematical model;Power system analysis computing;Power system modeling;Power system reliability;Power system transients;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Weibull distribution","Markov processes;Weibull distribution;power system reliability;stochastic processes","Weibull-Markov stochastic model;Weibull-distributions;bell-shaped duration distributions;electrical power systems;homogeneous Markov models;negative exponential distributions;nonsequential reliability assessment methods;power system reliability;reliability assessment;repair times;semi-Markov model;switching times","","2","","9","","","Aug 1999","02 May 1999-06 May 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several methods have been proposed for estimating the maximum velocity component - an important clinical parameter - but these methods are approximate solutions based on heuristic thresholds applied to the Doppler power spectrum. Reported here is a modeling of the Doppler power spectrum by the distribution of scatterer velocities; the resulting model provides the location of the peak velocity in terms of a threshold applied to the descending slope of the power spectrum. In particular it is shown that, for a parabolic velocity distribution, the peak velocity corresponds to the half-power point. This result is verified experimentally using Doppler spectra obtained from a sample volume intercepting laminar flows of peak velocity from ~ 7 - 20 cm/s. Peak velocities obtained from the half-slope frequency of the measured Doppler spectra show an error with + 0.3% bias and 1.5% standard deviation, suggesting this is an accurate model.","1051-0117;10510117","978-1-4577-1253-1;9781457712531","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2011.0066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6293072","Blood flow;Doppler spectrum;Maximum velocity measurement","Blood;Cells (biology);Doppler effect;Fluid flow measurement;Frequency measurement;Transducers;Velocity measurement","Doppler measurement;blood;cellular biophysics;haemodynamics;physiological models","Doppler power spectrum;accurate model;blood cells;blood flow;clinical parameter;half-power point;half-slope frequency;heuristic thresholds;maximum velocity component;parabolic velocity distribution;sample volume intercepting laminar flows;signal backscattering;standard deviation;velocity distribution","","2","","11","","","18-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It means that if one slot is set free among the first m ordered busy slots, the user who occupies the m-th slot (last position) will be reallocated to the released position.

The results indicated that it is difficult to find the right and sufficiently accurate variance covariance among gene expression data which defines the expression values the best. Also, the results indicated that there is less small negative correlation between intercept and slop among expression values within genes. This generally indicates those genes which get started with high expression values, likely decreases their expression across times. The analysis suggested that multilevel modeling can likely pinpoint to differentially expressed genes across whole dataset. As a side it concluded that by using multilevel modeling, genes which show periodic activity across time can be winnowed down too.","","978-1-4244-7483-7;9781424474837","","10.1109/ICBME.2010.5705026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705026","Human;Microarray;Multilevel Modeling;Time-course Data;component","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Gene expression;Humans;Time measurement;Time series analysis","bioinformatics;covariance analysis;genetics;physiological models;time series","error structure;gene expression data;human microarray time course data;multilevel modeling;negative correlation;periodic activity;variance covariance","","0","","10","","","3-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensitivity (frequency shift) of 15 MHz per unit permittivity at the center frequency of 6 GHz has been observed from the measurements, which is very close to the simulated value of 20 MHz - 22 MHz per unit permittivity change. The proof of concept is established using solutions or materials of known permittivity which are close to the calculated permittivity of cell suspensions with given cell concentrations. A further characterization of the sensor is done using standard supersaturated sugar solution.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686694","Dielectric permittivity;VCO readout;biosensor;cell suspension;lab on a chip;microwave","Dielectrics;Dispersion;Frequency measurement;Oscillators;Permittivity;Permittivity measurement;Suspensions","CMOS integrated circuits;biological techniques;capacitors;cellular biophysics;lab-on-a-chip;oscillators;permittivity","CMOS lab on a chip device;biological cell suspensions;cross coupled oscillator topology;dielectric characterization;dielectric permittivity;dielectric sensor;frequency 20 MHz to 22 MHz;frequency 6 GHz;interdigitated capacitor;sensitivity","","2","","12","","","6-10 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The annotated code is then automatically translated to code that manipulates auxiliary timer variables and is thus suitable as input to conventional, untimed software model checkers such as ESBMC. Moreover, we can check timing constraints in the same way and at the same time as untimed system requirements, and even allow for interaction between them.

Krasny","Ericsson Res., Durham, NC, USA","IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","20031110","2003","2","6","1204","1216","We focus on data transmission over continuous-time, dispersive M-input/single-output (MISO) channels where the transmitter knows all M channels. The biorthogonal Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion in the continuous-time domain is proposed as a unifying analytical framework for studying dispersive MISO channels. Using this KL expansion, we rigorously derive an expression for the capacity of the continuous-time dispersive MISO channel and show that a dispersive MISO channel is equivalent, in terms of channel capacity, to a dispersive single-input/multiple-output (SIMO) channel. Our derivations based on the KL expansion avoid the well-known problems associated with the ""frequency splitting"" approach. We show that the capacity-achieving transmitter for a dispersive MISO channel can be broken into two parts: (1) an optimal encoder for a dispersive single-input/single-output (SISO) channel and (2) an M-dimensional (M-D) matched filter (or a broadband beamformer). The M-D matched filter turns the original dispersive MISO channel into an equivalent SISO channel with exactly the same capacity as the capacity of the original MISO channel, and the one-dimensional encoder is just the well-known optimal encoder of Gallager for this equivalent SISO channel created by the M-D matched filter. As the number of transmit antennas increases, we show that the channel seen by the receiver approaches a flat-fading SISO channel (even when the individual forward channels are dispersive); hence, water filling in the transmitter can be dropped without much degradation. Second, this shows that with a large number of transmit antennas, the achievable data rate using a pre-RAKE at the transmitter and a very simple symbol-by-symbol detector at the receiver is quite close to the actual capacity of the dispersive MISO channel. With a large number of transmit antennas, this implies that the receiver for a capacity-achieving dispersive MISO system can be considerably less complex than the receiver for a dispersive SISO channel.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2003.819036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244798","","Channel capacity;Data communication;Degradation;Dispersion;Filling;Frequency;Matched filters;Receiving antennas;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas","Karhunen-Loeve transforms;MIMO systems;channel capacity;data communication;dispersive channels;encoding;matched filters;multidimensional digital filters;radio receivers;radio transmitters","KL expansion;M-D matched filter;achievable data rate;biorthogonal Karhunen-Loeve expansion;capacity-achieving receiver;capacity-achieving transmitter;channel capacity;continuous-time channels;continuous-time dispersive MISO channel;data transmission;dispersive SISO channel;dispersive single-input/multiple-output channel;flat-fading SISO channel;forward channels;frequency splitting;multi-dimensional matched filter;one-dimensional encoder;optimal encoder;pre-RAKE;symbol-by-symbol detector;transmit antennas","","4","3","19","","","Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Another possibility for improvement is to analyze spatial properties of the pixels classified as skin, but this operation strongly depends on the seed extraction technique.

We evaluate the merits of data-fitting methods based on derivative-free optimization (DFO) relative to gradient-based methods used in prior work. We further explore the advantages of alternative data sources through simulation of a model of time-resolved mass spectrometry data, a technology for monitoring bulk capsid assembly that can be expected to provide much richer data than previously used static light scattering approaches. The results show that advances in both the data and the algorithms can improve model inference.

In this case, the performance of large dataset transfers not only depends on the characteristics of the transfer protocol and network, but also the number and the size distribution of the files that constitute the dataset. GridFTP is the most advanced transfer tool that provides functions to overcome large dataset transfer bottlenecks. Three of the most important parameters of GridFTP are pipelining, parallelism and concurrency.

EMD computation is a special case of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein transshipment problem, and we exploit the Holder continuity constraint in its dual form to convert it into a simple optimization problem with an explicit solution in the wavelet domain. We prove that the resulting wavelet EMD metric is equivalent to EMD, i.e. the ratio of the two is bounded. We also provide estimates for the bounds. The weighted wavelet transform can be computed in time linear in the number of histogram bins, while the comparison is about as fast as for normal Euclidean distance or chi<sup>2</sup> statistic.

Poly(3-alkylthiophenes), containing alkyl side chains with more than four carbon atoms, are meltable and soluble in common solvents which make them possible to process with conventional techniques such as injection moulding and solution casting. However, these techniques may introduce new problems. During processing, polymers are exposed to high temperatures, shear forces and often also to oxygen. This may initiate different degradation reactions, ultimately leading to chain scission or crosslinking, and thus impaired properties. In this investigation, thin films of undoped poly(3-octylthiophene), POT, have been exposed to temperatures and atmospheres similar to processing conditions. Low molecular weight compounds and chemical treatment have been used for identification of the degradation products. The results show that the alpha-carbon position of the alkyl side chain is very sensitive to oxidation yielding carbonyl groups and crosslinks. Attempts to stabilize POT have also been carried out.","","","","10.1109/STSM.1994.835302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=835302","","Atmosphere;Casting;Chemical compounds;Chemical products;Degradation;Injection molding;Oxidation;Polymer films;Solvents;Temperature sensors","","","","0","","","","","24-29 July 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A flash cell is likely to wear out after undergoing excessive program/erase (P/E) flips. Wear leveling is hence employed to spread erase operations as evenly as possible. It is traditionally conducted by the flash translation layer (FTL), a management firmware residing in Hash devices. In this paper, we shall propose a novel wear leveling algorithm involving the operating system (OS). We will show that our operating System-Assisted Wear leveling (SAW) algorithm can significantly improve the wear evenness. SAW takes advantage of OS's knowledge about files at a higher level of abstraction, and provides useful hints to the lower-level FTL to accommodate data. A prototype based on a file system and an FTL has been developed to verify the effectiveness of SAW. Experiments show that wear evenness can be improved by as much as 85.0% compared to the state-of-the-art FTL wear leveling schemes.","0738-100X;0738100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560757","","Ash;Mathematical model;OWL;Prototypes;Resource management;Surface acoustic waves;Temperature distribution","NAND circuits;electronic engineering computing;firmware;flash memories;integrated circuit reliability;operating systems (computers)","NAND flash memory write endurance;OS;P-E flips;SAW leveling algorithm;file system;flash cell;flash translation layer;lower-level FTL wear leveling schemes;management firmware;operating system;program-erase flips;system-assisted wear leveling algorithm","","0","","20","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To examine the basic properties of shock waves generated by intense femtosecond lasers, we use a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code which is coupled to an electromagnetic wave solver. The latter is used to treat the coupling of the pump laser radiation to the sample and the interaction of an optical probe with the shock wave. Calculations have been made for a pump laser with a wavelength of 400 nm, pulse length of 120 fs (FWHM) and irradiances ranging from 10/sup 14/-10/sup 16/ W/cm/sup 2/. Aluminum is used as a material standard in our calculations because it is a simple metal and there is a relatively broad knowledge of its physical properties, both theoretically and experimentally. To describe the plasma and shock states produced, we use the quotidian equation of state QEOS and conductivities derived from the dense plasma model of Lee and More. Thermal equilibriation between electrons and ions is treated in a conduction-relaxation model.","0730-9244;07309244","0-7803-5982-8;0780359828","","10.1109/PLASMA.2000.854855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854855","","Electromagnetic coupling;Hydrodynamics;Laser excitation;Optical coupling;Plasma density;Plasma materials processing;Plasma properties;Pump lasers;Shock waves;Ultrafast optics","plasma production by laser;plasma shock waves","400 nm;Al;conduction-relaxation model;dense plasma model;electromagnetic wave solver;intense femtosecond lasers;one-dimensional hydrodynamic code;optical probe;plasma;pump laser radiation;quotidian equation of state;shock states;shock wave generation;thermal equilibriation","","0","","3","","","4-7 June 2000","04 Jun 2000-07 Jun 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low-energy operations are dominated by the production of toxic gas (ozone) and by some localized activation for bremsstrahlung operations. Ozone concentration is constantly monitored for electron-in-air operations. Problems with high-energy operations are related to target configuration and experimental design. This includes activation of various machine and experimental components and activation of room air. For some operations, ozone can also be a serious problem. A monitoring system was devised to distinguish between the 15O and 13N air-activation components.

Pham is with the Dept. of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia. (e-mail:: thuy.pham@sydney.edu.au).","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Goal: Respiratory artefact removal for the forced oscillation technique can be treated as an anomaly detection problem. Manual removal is currently considered the gold standard but this approach is laborious and subjective. Most existing automated techniques used simple statistics and/or rejected anomalous data points. Unfortunately, simple statistics are insensitive to numerous artefacts, leading to low reproducibility of results. Furthermore, rejecting anomalous data points causes an imbalance between the inspiratory and expiratory contributions. Methods: From a machine learning perspective, such methods are unsupervised and can be considered simple feature extraction. We hypothesize that supervised techniques can be used to find improved features that are more discriminative and more highly correlated with the desired output. Features thus found are then used for anomaly detection by applying quartile thresholding which rejects complete breaths if one of its features is out of range. The thresholds are determined by both saliency and performance metrics rather than qualitative assumptions as in previous works. Results: Feature ranking indicates that our new landmark features are among the highest scoring candidates regardless of age across saliency criteria. F1-scores, receiver operating characteristic, and variability of the mean resistance metrics show that the proposed scheme outperforms previous simple feature extraction approaches. Our subject-independent detector, 1IQR-SU, demonstrated approval rates of 80:6% for adults and 98% for children, higher than existing methods. Conclusion: Our new features are more relevant. Our removal is objective and comparable to the manual method. Significance: This is a critical work to automate FOT quality control.","0018-9294;00189294","","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2554599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453188","Respiratory artefacts;lung;machine learning","Australia;Feature extraction;Lungs;Measurement;Oscillators;Pediatrics;Standards","","","","","","","","2016-04-15","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This model is clearly differentiated from the classical task model where parameters are fixed at the job release time. The new model better suits sensing tasks in tracking applications, since the sensor parameters such as field-of-view and measurement duration can be properly adjusted at the actual sensing time. The new model, however, creates the cyclic dependency between task parameters and scheduling behavior, that is, the task parameters depend on scheduling behavior and the latter in turn depends on the former. This cyclic dependency makes the schedulability check even more difficult. We handle this difficulty by iterative convergence and probabilistic schedulability envelope, which provides an efficient online schedulability check. The experimental study shows that the new model significantly improves the effective capacity of tracking systems without losing track accuracy","1052-8725;10528725","0-7695-2490-7;0769524907","","10.1109/RTSS.2005.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563112","","Antenna measurements;Infrared sensors;Job design;Processor scheduling;Radar antennas;Radar tracking;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm;Target tracking;Time measurement","real-time systems;scheduling;tracking","cyclic dependency;iterative convergence;online scheduling;probabilistic schedulability envelope;real-time tracking;scheduling behavior;task parameters;time-parameterized sensing task model","","4","","20","","","8-8 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We adapt a coupled inductor which consists of a boost inductor and a resonant inductor to ZCT converters. To analyze and simulate a magnetic field distribution of the coupled inductor, the ANSYS software is employed.

While much understanding on single token rings (single server polling systems) has been acquired over the years, little is understood about multi-token systems.

Modeling the system by a polling system, we address the question of how to efficiently operate multiple servers in a multi-queue environment with switch-over times. We demonstrate that the use of a simple cyclic visit order for the servers leads the servers to ""stick together"" and results in performance degradation since the servers are not evenly spread among the queues; in this system the servers suffer from lack of walk sharing, since they all concurrently waste their time on walking (switching) from queue to queue. An alternative approach in which each of the servers is dedicated to serve a subset of the queues is shown to resolve that problem but suffers from performance degradation due to lack of work sharing by the servers. We discuss the properties of work sharing and walk sharing and demonstrate how the lack of them affects the cyclic server policy and the dedicated server policy. We propose a novel approach, called the 'bang bang' policy. with this policy the servers are not dedicated to particular subsets of the queues, and thus the policy allows work sharing among the servers. Furthermore, the policy prevents the servers from 'sticking together"" and thus allows for walk sharing among them. As such, the policy overcomes the deficiencies of the other two policies. The ma- n idea of the ""bang bang"" policy is that afteR the servers meet, they continue to move in opposite directions. Numerical results show that the ""bang bang"" policy performs significantly better than the other two policies over a wide range of parameters.","","","","10.1109/CAMAD.1994.765647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=765647","","Analytical models;Communication system control;Computer simulation;Degradation;Delay estimation;Intelligent networks;Network servers;Performance analysis;Telecommunication control;Token networks","","","","0","","","","","24-27 April 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems call for appropriate management mechanisms and protocols. Slicing is an example of an autonomous, fully decentralized protocol suitable for large-scale environments. It aims at organizing the system into groups of nodes, called slices, according to an application-specific criteria where the size of each slice is relative to the size of the full system. This allows assigning a certain fraction of nodes to different task, according to their capabilities. Although useful, current slicing techniques lack some features of considerable practical importance. This paper proposes a slicing protocol, that builds on existing solutions, and addresses some of their frailties. We present novel solutions to deal with non-uniform slices and to perform online and dynamic slices schema reconfiguration. Moreover, we describe how to provision a slice-local Peer Sampling Service for upper protocol layers and how to enhance slicing protocols with the capability of slicing over more than one attribute.

The operating system used is Microsoft Windows and Windows for Workgroups 3.1. Since each object is autonomous, they can assume the properties of self-monitoring agents in the system rather than simple request servers under the sole control of the calling object. Communication between objects is facilitated by the operating system using dynamic data exchange (DDE) calls or by compiling the module into dynamic link library (DLL) modules.

This paper proposes a novel application of this concept, where in the presence of an eavesdropper, the secondary cooperation aims at improving the secrecy of the primary network. It does this by creating more interference to the eavesdropper than to the primary receiver. To generate the interference in a positive way, this paper studies an optimal design of a beamformer at the secondary transmitter with multiple antennas. The design maximizes the secrecy rate of the primary network while satisfying a required rate for the secondary network. Moreover, we investigate two scenarios that are contingent on how the eavesdropper operates: 1) The eavesdropper treats the interference by the secondary transmission as additive noise [single-user decoding (SD)]; and 2) the eavesdropper tries to decode and remove the secondary signal [joint decoding (JD)]. Numerical results confirm that, for a wide range of required secondary-rate constraints, the proposed spectrum-leasing strategy increases the secrecy rate of the primary network.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2013.2269617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542716","Pareto boundary;physical-layer security;power gain region;secrecy capacity;spectrum leasing","Array signal processing;Decoding;Interference;Receivers;Transmitters;Vectors;Wireless communication","array signal processing;cooperative communication;decoding;interference (signal);radio spectrum management;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","additive noise;beamformer;cooperative communication;interference;joint decoding;physical-layer secrecy;primary network;primary receiver;secondary network;secondary transmission;secondary transmitter;secondary users;spectrum leasing","","7","","18","","2013-06-18","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE International Conference on","20030620","2003","3","","2071","2075 vol.3","The orthogonality between sub-carriers in OFDM systems is disrupted by offsets between the carrier frequencies in the transmitter and receiver as well by the so-called IQ mismatch in the mixers. When treated separately, effective algorithms exist for estimation and compensation of frequency offset as well as IQ imbalance. However, with both effects present, such algorithms do not lead to useful estimates of the related parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the estimation of the frequency offset in the presence of IQ imbalance.

Automated face recognition is identifying a given query face called probe from a target population known as gallery. The face recognition algorithms perform well when the interpersonal images have more discriminating features than intra personal images. The changes in the face bring down the similarity of the intrapersonal images. The variations in the face can be due to pose, expression, illumination changes and aging of a person. Face recognition accuracy is largely influenced by the age related changes in face. Aging effects on face are not uniform and depend on both intrinsic as well as external factors like geographic location, race, food habits etc. The facial changes are exclusive for each person in spite of aging being an apparent phenomenon among all individuals. Hence there are many challenges still open in compensating age related variations. In this paper we have proposed a novel self-PCA based approach in order to consider distinctiveness of the effects of aging of a person for age invariant face recognition. The region around the eyes is used as the input feature instead of the entire face as it is more stable part of the face with respect to aging and also requires less space.

The key insight is that branch prediction can be used to selectively wake up only the needed cache line. This achieves better leakage savings than the best prior policies while avoiding the performance overheads of those policies, without needing an extra prediction structure. The proposed policy reduces leakage energy by 92.7 percent with only 0.08 percent performance overhead on average. The branch-prediction-based approach requires an extra pipeline stage for wake up, which adds to the branch misprediction penalty. Fortunately, this cost is mitigated because the extra wake-up stage is overlapped with misprediction recovery. This paper assumes the superdrowsy leakage control technique using reduced supply voltage because it is well suited to the instruction cache's criticality. However, the proposed policy can be also applied to other leakage-saving circuit techniques.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2007.70770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358227","Cache memories;Energy-aware systems;Low-power design;Microprocessors","Circuits;Cooling;Costs;Degradation;Energy dissipation;Pipelines;Power dissipation;Semiconductor device packaging;Telephony;Threshold voltage;Voltage control","cache storage;leakage currents;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips","branch prediction;cache leakage energy;leakage power reduction;microprocessor;on-demand wake-up prediction policy;performance maintenance;reduced supply voltage;superdrowsy leakage control","","3","3","31","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nonstationary channels are modeled as finite-state Markov chains. The system counts the number of retransmission requests during an observation interval called a frame and, together with knowledge of the code in use and a set of thresholds, estimates the state of the channel.

This integration provides a problem-independent optimization strategy for large-scale constrained optimization problems over finite domains. In this approach, genetic operators are based on an arc-consistency algorithm, and chromosomes are arc-consistent portions of the search space of the problem. The paper describes the main issues arising in this integration: chromosome representation and evaluation, selection and replacement strategies, and the design of genetic operators. We also present a parallel execution model for a distributed memory architecture of the previous integration. We have adopted a global parallelization approach that preserves the properties, behavior, and fundamentals of the sequential algorithm. Linear speedup is achieved since genetic operators are coarse grained as they perform a search in a discrete space carrying out arc consistency. The implementation has been tested on a GRAY T3E multiprocessor using a complex constrained optimization problem.","1089-778X;1089778X","","","10.1109/4235.887235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887235","","Biological cells;Computer languages;Constraint optimization;Data structures;Design optimization;Evolutionary computation;Genetics;Large scale integration;Memory architecture;Testing","constraint theory;genetic algorithms;mathematics computing;parallel processing;search problems","arc consistency;constrained optimization;constraint-solving;distributed memory architecture;evolution programs;genetic algorithm;parallel execution model;search space","","5","1","47","","","Nov 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Motion Estimation Without Integer-Pel Search","L. Li; S. Liu; Y. Chen; T. Chen; T. Luo","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","20130204","2013","22","4","1340","1353","The typical motion estimation (ME) consists of three main steps, including spatial-temporal prediction, integer-pel search, and fractional-pel search. The integer-pel search, which seeks the best matched integer-pel position within a search window, is considered to be crucial for video encoding. It occupies over 50% of the overall encoding time (when adopting the full search scheme) for software encoders, and introduces remarkable area cost, memory traffic, and power consumption to hardware encoders. In this paper, we find that video sequences (especially high-resolution videos) can often be encoded effectively and efficiently even without integer-pel search. Such counter-intuitive phenomenon is not only because that spatial-temporal prediction and fractional-pel search are accurate enough for the ME of many blocks. In fact, we observe that when the predicted motion vector is biased from the optimal motion vector (mainly for boundary blocks of irregularly moving objects), it is also hard for integer-pel search to reduce the final rate-distortion cost: the deviation of reference position could be alleviated with the fractional-pel interpolation and rate-distortion optimization techniques (e.g., adaptive macroblock mode). Considering the decreasing proportion of boundary blocks caused by the increasing resolution of videos, integer-pel search may be rather cost-ineffective in the era of high-resolution. Experimental results on 36 typical sequences of different resolutions encoded with x264, which is a widely-used video encoder, comply with our analysis well. For 1080p sequences, removing the integer-pel search saves 57.9% of the overall H.264 encoding time on average (compared to the original x264 with full integer-pel search using default parameters), while the resultant performance loss is negligible: the bit-rate is increased by only 0.18%, while the peak signal-to-noise ratio is decreased by only 0.01 dB per frame averagely.","1057-7149;10577149","","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2228495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6357281","Integer-pel search;motion compensation;motion estimation;motion vector prediction;video coding","Accuracy;Interpolation;Motion estimation;Rate-distortion;Spatial resolution;Vectors;Video sequences","image sequences;interpolation;motion estimation;optimisation;video coding","adaptive macroblock mode;boundary blocks;fractional-pel interpolation;fractional-pel search;high-resolution videos;motion estimation;rate-distortion optimization;spatial-temporal prediction;video encoding;video sequences","","1","","59","","2012-11-20","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In fact, the physiological knowledge improvement in a wide variety of innovative research as well as the implementation in many clinical procedures extensively makes use of these concepts in more or less sophisticated medical applications. In this article, the important links between BSIP and physiological modeling and their important derived synergies are particularly stressed. In support of this aim, examples have been provided in the areas of cardiovascular system studies, as well as in neurosciences and functional imaging, by using different modalities. Along this direction, the integration operation of the detected information between multiple signals, organs, modalities, and across multiple scales (from gene/protein levels up to cell and organ levels) seems to be extremely promising. Further, advanced methods in the area of information treatment, such as time-frequency and time-variant approaches, have been investigated in the biomedical field together with the complexity measurements, most often carried out through nonlinear dynamical approaches where, also in this context, the integration between modeling and information processing plays a fundamental role. Finally, a few examples have been described in which the study of EMFs, in the form of signals and images properly detected, have a relevant impact on various biomedical applications.","2154-2287;21542287","","","10.1109/MPUL.2011.941522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5783430","","Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Biomedical image processing;Biomedical monitoring;Data models;Heart rate variability","bio-optics;biological organs;cardiovascular system;cellular biophysics;electroencephalography;genetics;infrared spectra;magnetocardiography;medical image processing;molecular biophysics;physiological models;positron emission tomography;proteins","biological cells;biological organs;biomedical engineering;biomedical image processing;biomedical signal processing;cardiovascular system;complexity measurements;functional imaging;gene;information processing;neurosciences;physiological knowledge improvement;physiological modeling;protein;time-frequency approach;time-variant approach","Algorithms;Biomedical Engineering;Diagnostic Imaging;Electrodiagnosis;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","0","","89","","","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Under spark initiation, simultaneous ignition inside the discharge channel resulted in a conventional deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) via an adiabatic explosion. The DDT length and time at 0.3 bar of initial pressure amounted to 250 mm and 300 Â¿s, respectively.

The square wave signal circulating around the ring oscillator, at a reduced power supply voltage, serves as a small signal excitation for the <i>CV</i> characterization. Gate charging times of order 40 ps enable capacitance measurement in the presence of the high parallel conductance of thin gate dielectrics. MOSFET parameters such as inversion and depletion capacitances and electrical channel length can be self-consistently compared with circuit power/performance, all derived as averages over hundreds of MOSFETs from the same test structure. This minimizes dependencies on layout, spatial and statistical variations, as well as other ambiguities that can exist when a variety of test structures is used to evaluate different MOSFET and circuit performance parameters.

The model essentially divides the signal into two channels, below and above 1000 Hz, computes a “generalized” autocorrelation of the low-channel signal and of the envelope of the high-channel signal, and sums the autocorrelation functions. The summary autocorrelation function (SACF) is further processed to obtain an enhanced SACF (ESACF). The SACF and ESACP representations are used in observing the periodicities of the signal. The model performance is demonstrated to be comparable to those of recent time-domain models that apply a multichannel analysis. In contrast to the multichannel models, the proposed pitch analysis model can be run in real time using typical personal computers. The parameters of the model are experimentally tuned for best multipitch discrimination with typical mixtures of complex tones. The proposed pitch analysis model may be used in complex audio signal processing applications, such as sound source separation, computational auditory scene analysis, and structural representation of audio signals. The performance of the model is demonstrated by pitch analysis examples using sound mixtures which are available for download at http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/-ttolonen/pitchAnalysis/","1063-6676;10636676","","","10.1109/89.876309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=876309","","Acoustic signal processing;Application software;Autocorrelation;Computational modeling;Image analysis;Microcomputers;Performance analysis;Signal analysis;Source separation;Time domain analysis","audio signal processing;computational complexity;hearing;signal representation;speech processing","autocorrelation;complex audio signal processing;complex audio signals;complex tones;computational auditory scene analysis;computationally efficient multipitch analysis model;high-channel signal;low-channel signal;model performance;multipitch discrimination;periodicity analysis;pitch analysis model;signal periodicities;signal representations;sound mixtures;sound source separation;speech signals;structural representation;summary autocorrelation function","","103","9","35","","","Nov 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To verify the performance of PFED, PFED is implemented in NS2 and is compared with RED and CHOKe with respect to different performance metrics. Simulation results show that PFED outperforms RED and CHOKe in stabling instantaneous queue length and in fairness. It is also shown that PFED enables the link capacity to be fully utilized by stabilizing the queue length at a desirable level, while not incurring excessive packet loss ratio.","0190-3918;01903918","0-7695-2380-3;0769523803","","10.1109/ICPP.2005.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1488646","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Engineering management;Inductors;Information science;Mean square error methods;Measurement;Probability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","least mean squares methods;queueing theory;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","minimum mean square error predictor;network traffic prediction;packet drop probability;prediction-based fair active queue management algorithm","","2","","18","","","14-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a mechanism is presented that prevents the occurrence of stuff bits in the whole frame completely. It makes the duration of frame transmissions fixed and, hence, it achieves very accurate reception times. An optimized codec has been implemented to demonstrate that this approach is feasible and can be profitably adopted in low-cost networked embedded systems with demanding timing constraints.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2014.2365153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936873","Controller area network (CAN);industrial control;real-time distributed systems","Encoding;Informatics;Jitter;Payloads;Polynomials;Timing;Tuning","controller area networks;cyclic redundancy check codes;embedded systems","CAN;bit stuffing mechanism;controller area networks;cyclic redundancy check;jitterless communication;low-cost networked embedded systems;optimized codec","","1","","24","","2014-10-27","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are attractive light sources in optical communication systems. Near threshold VCSELs usually emit in a dominant linearly polarized mode with a 15-30 dB suppressed orthogonally-polarized mode. When the injection current is increased in many devices it is observed that the polarization switches to the orthogonal state.

The artificial nose consists of an array of chemical sensors and an electronic system capable of recognizing patterns odors simple and complex. The performance of a sensor network is discussed by using pattern recognition methods. These methods can be supervised methods or unsupervised.

"Speech Enhancement Using Harmonic Emphasis and Adaptive Comb Filtering","W. Jin; X. Liu; M. S. Scordilis; L.

A spectral weighting function is derived by constrained optimization to suppress noise in the frequency domain. Two design parameters are included in the suppression gain, namely, the frequency-dependent noise-flooring parameter (FDNFP) and the gain factor. The FDNFP controls the level of admissible residual noise in the enhanced speech. Enhanced harmonic structures are incorporated into the FDNFP by time-domain processing of the linear prediction residuals of voiced speech. Further enhancement of the harmonics is achieved by adaptive comb filtering derived using the gain factor with a peak-picking algorithm. The performance of the enhancement method was evaluated by the modified bark spectral distance (MBSD), ITU-Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) scores, composite objective measures and listening tests. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms spectral subtraction; a main signal subspace method applicable to both white and colored noise conditions and a perceptually based enhancement method with a constant noise-flooring parameter, particularly at lower signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Our listening test indicated that 16 listeners on average preferred the proposed approach over any of the other three approaches about 73% of the time.","1558-7916;15587916","","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2028916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5184899","Constrained optimization;harmonic enhancement;speech enhancement","","adaptive filters;comb filters;signal denoising;speech enhancement;time-domain analysis","adaptive comb filtering;additive noise;constant noise-flooring parameter;constrained optimization;enhanced harmonic structures;frequency domain;frequency-dependent noise-flooring parameter;gain factor;low signal-to-noise ratio conditions;modified bark spectral distance;noise suppression;peak-picking algorithm;signal subspace method;single-channel speech;spectral weighting function;speech enhancement;time-domain processing","","9","","39","","2009-07-31","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes an enhanced carrier sensing algorithm based on statistical characteristics to enhance the carrier sensing mechanism for the original CSMA/CA. An enhanced CCA module based on statistical characteristics is developed to evaluate the efficiency of radio resource management (RRM). Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than existing CCA mechanism in IEEE 802.11 standards, which in turn significantly improves throughput, and reduces backoff time, average medium access control (MAC) delay and power consumption of CCA detection.","2161-9646;21619646","978-1-4244-6250-6;9781424462506","","10.1109/wicom.2011.6036699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6036699","","Analytical models;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Multiaccess communication;Resource management;Sensors;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","carrier sense multiple access;cognitive radio;telecommunication network management;wireless LAN","CCA detection;CCA mechanism;CSMA-CA;IEEE 802.11 standards;MAC delay;RRM;blind backoff process;busy channel detection;channel utilization;cognitive radio systems;enhanced carrier sensing algorithm;enhanced clear channel assessment;medium access control delay;radio resource management;sensor nodes;statistical characteristics;wireless LAN","","0","","7","","","23-25 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Testing of the bubble shows how heater power and ambient pressure affect bubble shape, size, and optical reflection characteristics. Heat and fluid flow in the bubble were modeled in 2D and 3D using the homogeneous bubble model in the Flow3D modeling software. Fluid condensing on the trench wall causes a dimple on the bubble and hence nonoptimum optical reflection. To aid understanding, the bubble, silica walls, and heaters were also modeled as a thermal resistance network. Because the pressure drop across the bubble wall is fixed, the bubble size is determined by P<sub>res</sub>/DeltaT<sub>t </sub>, where P<sub>res</sub> is the heater power and DeltaT<sub>t </sub> is the temperature difference between the bubble and the substrate. Heating the trench walls beyond the bubble temperature with heaters located underneath the trench wall will dry out the trench wall and give a stable optical reflection.

Real-world texture images often present challenges for classification algorithms in terms of intra-class variability due, among others, to variable illumination. The LBP operator, a state-of-the-art texture descriptor, possesses key properties for tackling real-world texture images: discriminative power and invariance against monotonic gray level changes. We propose a novel texture classification approach that increases the robustness of LBP-based methods with respect to any type of intra-class variations. The method locally characterizes each pixel with an LBP code histogram and globally computes the label of a textured image by aggregating pixel labels through a voting process. Our approach can be in principle applied to any LBP version, as it focuses on how statistics are computed from LBP codes. We show that the proposed pixel-based approach improves upon traditional LBP block-based approaches in terms of classification accuracy by up to 5.1 p.p. on the public Outex database for the classic LBP with various neighborhoods as well as for various LBP extensions.","1070-9908;10709908","","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2461026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167687","Image classification;image texture;local binary pattern;pixel-based classification","Face recognition;Histograms;Image classification;Joints;Protocols;Robustness","image classification;image texture","intraclass variation;pixel-based LBP statistic aggregation mechanism;pixel-based local binary pattern statistic aggregation mechanism;public Outex database;robust image texture classification;voting process","","0","","20","","2015-07-27","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In false report injection attacks, adversaries inject false reports into networks by using compromised nodes in these networks. Such attacks cause not only false alarms, but they also shorten the network's life. The statistical en-route filtering scheme aims to detect and drop false reports en route. In the routing process, each forwarding node performs a role that verifies event reports utilizing its own keys and drops false reports. Therefore, path selection to transmit event reports can be an important element for guaranteeing network security. In this paper, we propose a secure path determination method for statistical en-route filtering based wireless sensor networks. According to the proposed method, the base station floods route messages that contain information of a forwarding path. According to the result of evaluation functions based on obtained information, each node chooses a path with consideration to security and energy efficiency.

The incidence of streaming electrification in large transformers (and other industrial equipment) has generated the need for both an understanding and mathematical description of the physics. Modelling of the phenomena is needed since the mechanisms do not readily scale so that small-scale laboratory experiments cannot be used to predict performance. This contribution chronicles the development of both steady-state and transient descriptions of the streaming electrification process. The nature of the phenomenon is such that appropriate assumptions and approximations need to be made. As a consequence, it is also important to include some experimental verification of the outcomes; at least in qualitative form. The entrainment of charge from the interface Helmholtz layer also intimately involves the flow of the liquid. A description of the flow regimes and a transient solution of the flow through a duct are thus an integral part of the modelling effort The utility of the steady-state model developed is demonstrated by application to an oil-cellulose system typical of a large core-form transformer. The method advocated takes advantage of the repeat duct arrangement in such units. The results presented allow the internal behaviour of such a unit to be studied in considerable depth, and provide insight into the complex interplay between generation and relaxation in circumstances when flow rates, temperature, external fields and influent charge are changed.","","0-7803-7350-2;0780373502","","10.1109/ICDL.2002.1022682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022682","","Dielectric liquids;Ducts;Electrical equipment industry;Fluid flow;Laboratories;Physics;Predictive models;Solids;Steady-state;Transformers","electric charge;impregnated insulation;paper;pipe flow;power transformer insulation;transformer cores;transformer insulation","charge separation;design tools;dielectric liquids;duct;enforced flow;flow regimes;interface Helmholtz layer;internal behaviour;large core-form transformer;large transformers;liquid flow;liquid-solid interface;oil-cellulose system;repeat duct arrangement;solid interface;static charges accumulation;steady-state descriptions;steady-state model;streaming electrification;transient descriptions","","0","","27","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the PM of the parallel shape array has nonnegligible drawbacks such as 1) requirement of pair matching between the 2-D azimuth and elevation angle estimation which is an exhaustive search and 2) estimation failure problems when elevation angles are between 70° and 90°. The purpose of this paper is to show a way to remove these problems in the PM without additional computational loads. This paper will employ one or two L-shape arrays because the parallel shape used in the PM may cause the aforesaid problems. Simulation results verify that the PM with one or two L-shape configurations can remove these problems and improve the performance of the PM significantly, e.g., almost 5 dB in signal to noise ratio for the parameters used in this paper.","0018-926X;0018926X","","","10.1109/TAP.2005.846804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1427919","Antenna array;Smart antenna;direction-of-arrival angle (DOA) estimation;propagator method (PM)","Array signal processing;Azimuth;Direction of arrival estimation;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Matrix decomposition;Mobile communication;Multiple signal classification;Shape;Signal processing algorithms;Singular value decomposition","adaptive antenna arrays;antenna theory;array signal processing;correlation theory;direction-of-arrival estimation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;singular value decomposition","DOA;EVD;L-shape array;SVD;antenna array;computational load;cross-correlation matrix;direction-of-arrival angle estimation;eigenvalue decomposition;parallel shape array;propagator method;received data;singular value decomposition;smart antenna","","83","","16","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The smart grid derives its functionality from several existing technologies and standards. At issue is that most of these base standards were developed for specific functionality and security was added later. As such, most standards do not have a unified and comprehensive approach to security, which results in security gaps in these standards. In this paper, we investigate common security issues in smart grid standards that employ communication protocols and the common causes for these issues. We then propose security considerations for developing these standards; to address them, we develop guidelines for drafting security into smart grid standards either when they are updated or when new standards are developed. We draw examples from the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile standard for security requirements, objectives, and to make recommendations for designing security in similar standards. We finally present a retrospective discussion of how following our recommendations would have improved the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile standard by including security in a unified and comprehensive way.","","978-1-4673-0161-9;9781467301619","978-1-4673-0162-6;9781467301626","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309314","","Cryptography;Guidelines;Privacy;Smart grids;Standards;Zigbee","Zigbee;power system security;smart power grids","ZigBee Smart Energy Profile standard;communication protocols;interoperability;protocols;security gaps;security issues;smart grid specifications","","1","","20","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analytical formulae for spring constants and sensitivity of such monomorph have been established. The performed analysis permits us to state the optimal parameters of the sensor dimensions and the Young's modulus of applied materials. An important factor is the position of the nodal plane and its influence on sensor sensitivity. Various combinations of ceramic plates and metal foils were theoretically analyzed, then applied in practical realizations of the sensors. The sensor with a tip was applied to a contact ultrasonic microscope, and replaced the optical sensor commonly used to measure the deflection amplitude of the tip during scanning the surfaces of the sample. Such a method enables us to create the three-dimensional images of the surface. The sensors produced were calibrated using the quasi-static method. Sensors of this kind may fulfil requirements necessary in investigating surface properties of materials applied in modern electronics and technology.","0885-3010;08853010","","","10.1109/58.741537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=741537","","Bonding;Ceramics;Force sensors;Magnetic sensors;Optical microscopy;Optical sensors;Piezoelectric materials;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface topography","Young's modulus;acoustic microscopy;piezoelectric transducers;ultrasonic transducers","Young modulus;cantilever;ceramic plate;material surface;metal foil;monomorph;piezoelectric sensor;sensitivity;spring constant;three-dimensional image;ultrasonic contact microscopy","","0","","18","","","Jan. 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, it also brings additional operational risks for the consolidated system because the impacts of hardware failures, human errors, and security breaches can be vastly magnified in that densely packed environment. In order to mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a new virtualization and consolidation analysis engine(VCAE), which exploits and utilizes various constraints in the consolidation process. VCAE provides a comprehensive framework to discover, represent, check, and combine various constraints in server consolidation. It can assist system operators to effectively deal with the large number of constraints in the consolidation planning. In addition, VCAE proposes an evolution based method to discover the optimal consolidation scheme under multiple constraints. As a consequence, the consolidation solution generated by VCAE can not only maximize the utilization of system resources but also keep the hidden risks as low as possible in the consolidated system. The experimental results from an real enterprise system have demonstrated the advantages of our analysis engine.","1949-3673;19493673","978-1-4244-8537-6;9781424485376","978-0-7695-4232-4;9780769542324","10.1109/SASO.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5630892","constraints;optimization;server consolidation;virtualization","Engines;Hardware;Maintenance engineering;Planning;Resource management;Security;Servers","business communication;computer centres;file servers;security of data;virtual machines","consolidation planning;enterprise data centers;hardware failures;human errors;large scale data centers;real enterprise system;security breaches;server consolidation;system operators;system resources;virtualization and consolidation analysis engine","","2","","23","","","Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Gain matrices of model-based adaptive control in a continuous-time system are allowed high gain positive definite. However, the maximum of the gains depends on the sampling time, and gain tuning is a very time consuming work. Therefore, it is desirable to give an insight of gain tuning in discrete-time adaptive control. The proposed gain tuning consists of two steps. The first step is a gain tuning at the basic sampling time by a skillful specialist by means of trial and error. The second step that is executed if the sampling period changes, is a new gain calculation based on a new sampling period. The simulation and experiments of 1-dof robot and 3-dof robot show that the proposed gain tuned controller is stable at the large variance of the sampling period changes and more accurate than the fixed gain controller.","","0-7803-8352-4;0780383524","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324268","","","adaptive control;discrete time systems;manipulators;matrix algebra;sampling methods;stability","discrete time adaptive control;gain control;gain matrices;gain tuning method;model based adaptive control;one dof robot;sampling period;stability;three dof robot;trial and error method","","0","","9","","","4-6 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both approaches were shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on large-scale object categorization datasets, such as ImageNet. Conceptually, however, they are perceived as very different and it is not uncommon for heated debates to spring up when advocates of both paradigms meet at conferences or workshops. In this work, we emphasize the similarities between both architectures rather than their differences and we argue that such a unified view allows us to transfer ideas from one domain to the other. As a concrete example we introduce a method for learning a support vector machine classifier with Fisher kernel at the same time as a task-specific data representation. We reinterpret the setting as a multi-layer feed forward network. Its final layer is the classifier, parameterized by a weight vector, and the two previous layers compute Fisher vectors, parameterized by the coefficients of a Gaussian mixture model. We introduce a gradient descent based learning algorithm that, in contrast to other feature learning techniques, is not just derived from intuition or biological analogy, but has a theoretical justification in the framework of statistical learning theory. Our experiments show that the new training procedure leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy while preserving the modularity and geometric interpretability of a support vector machine setup.","1063-6919;10636919","","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909578","Fisher kernel;Gaussian mixture models;deep learning;image classification;support vector machines","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Computer vision;Kernel;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","Gaussian processes;feedforward neural nets;gradient methods;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","Fisher kernel GMM parameters;Fisher vectors;Gaussian mixture model;classification accuracy improvements;deep Fisher kernels;deep learning;end to end learning;geometric interpretability;gradient descent-based learning algorithm;large-scale object categorization datasets;modularity preservation;multilayer feedforward network;statistical learning theory;support vector machine classifier;task-specific data representation;weight vector","","4","","42","","","23-28 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, we show that the case of a scene made of a single surface results in a simple constraint in the Fourier domain. We derive two basic types of algorithms for volumetric reconstruction: One based on a dense set of defocused images, and one based on a sparse set of defocused images.

The extracellular pH of a cell culture is a particularly important indicator of global cellular metabolism, but up until now, this property has typically been measured with invasive and expensive techniques such as miniaturized glass microelectrodes, fluorescent ratio imaging microscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Using different names for the same concepts and different concepts with the same name makes it effectively impossible for humans and computers alike to analyze biological processes across different organisms. The consortium addresses this need by defining terms for categorizing genes and gene products. A convention in GO is that each gene or gene product is annotated to the most specific GO term in the GO database. It is, however, also useful for researchers to be able to group genesor gene products into broad biological categories that give a higher-level view of their function when analyzing results of an experiment. A GO Slim is a subset of the GO ontology that provides such a higher-level view of functions. Existing GO Slim generation tools have two important limitations: programming language dependence, and an inability to dynamically generate a GO Slim while analyzing. We have extended the relational database engine to dynamically generate a GO Slim overcoming this limitations. Using this extension, we have developed a tool (Dynamic GOSlim) that dynamically generates a GO Slim and uses the generated GO Slim to categorize genes or gene products.

All popular commercial stereoscopic systems suffer from crosstalk to some extent. Studies show that crosstalk causes distortions, reduces image quality and visual comfort, and increases perceived workload. Moreover, there is evidence that crosstalk effects depth perception from disparity. In the present paper we present two experiments. The first addresses the effect of crosstalk on the perceived magnitude of depth from disparity. The second examines the effect of crosstalk on the magnitude of depth perceived from monocular occlusions. Our data show that crosstalk has a detrimental effect on depth perceived from both cues, but it has a stronger effect on depth from monocular occlusions. Our findings taken together with previous results suggest that crosstalk, even in modest amounts, noticeably degrades the quality of stereoscopic images.","0018-9316;00189316","","","10.1109/TBC.2011.2105630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5704530","Crosstalk;ghosting;human factors;stereo vision;three-dimensional displays","Crosstalk;Glass;Gray-scale;Image color analysis;Observers;Statistical analysis;Visualization","crosstalk;three-dimensional displays;visual perception","crosstalk effect;depth perception;monocular occlusions;perceived depth;stereoscopic displays;stereoscopic image quality;visual comfort","","14","","32","","2011-01-31","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The small power converters are utilized to achieve both SOC balancing between the battery cells and dc bus voltage regulation at the same time. The battery cells' SOC imbalance issue is addressed from the root by using the energy sharing concept to automatically adjust the discharge/charge rate of each cell while maintaining a regulated dc bus voltage. Consequently, there is no need to transfer the excess energy between the cells for SOC balancing. The theoretical basis and experimental prototype results are provided to illustrate and validate the proposed energy sharing controller.","0278-0046;02780046","","","10.1109/TIE.2014.2363817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928473","Battery Management System;Battery management system (BMS);Cell Balancing;Cell Equalization;DCDC Converter;Electric Vehicles;Lithium-Ion Battery;Mobile Device;Notebook Computer Battery Pack;SOC Balancing;Smart Grid;State of Charge;cell balancing;cell equalization;dc???dc converter;electric vehicles (EVs);lithium-ion battery;mobile device;notebook computer battery pack;smart grid;state of charge;state-of-charge balancing","Batteries;Computer architecture;DC-DC power converters;Microprocessors;System-on-chip;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;battery management systems;power control;secondary cells","DC bus voltage regulation system;battery cell SOC imbalance issue;battery cells;cell balancing system;discharge-charge rate;distributed battery energy storage system architecture;energy sharing SOC balancing control scheme;energy sharing state-of-charge balancing control scheme;power DC-DC power converter;regulated DC bus voltage","","13","","33","","2014-10-17","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, a two-step process is proposed based on the equivalence principle and the electric field integral equation method to complete the radiation prediction. The tangential electric fields over the slots on shielding boxes are first sampled to be the equivalent magnetic currents radiated from internal PCBs. In the second step, to avoid the computation of complex nonanalytical dyadic Green's functions when the field radiation is computed directly from the equivalent source, the surface current induced by the equivalent magnetic current is calculated by the method of moments. As a result, the total radiated emission is the superposition of both equivalent magnetic current source and induced current. To prove the validity and accuracy of the proposed approach, near-field and far-field radiations from PCBs in enclosed environments are benchmarked and compared with simulated references.","0018-9375;00189375","","","10.1109/TEMC.2013.2251420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6484937","Dyadic green’s function;equivalence principle;method of moments (MoM);perfect electrical conductor (PEC);planar electric near-field (NF) sampling;scattering issue;shielding box","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Magnetic noise;Magnetic shielding;Method of moments;Noise measurement;Surface impedance","Green's function methods;electromagnetic compatibility;equivalent circuits;shielding","complex nonanalytical dyadic Green's functions;electric field integral equation method;electromagnetic compatibility;equivalence principle;equivalent magnetic current source;equivalent magnetic currents;equivalent source;field radiation;interference characterizations;internal PCB;radiated emissions;radiation prediction;radiators;shielding boxes;surface current;tangential electric fields;tangential electrical field samplings;ventilation slots","","2","","22","","2013-03-22","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Secondly, and equally importantly, this paper is intended to serve as a cautionary tale against believing one's own intuition about the causes of poor system performance. We went into this study believing we understood a number of the causes for these delays, with our beliefs informed more by conventional wisdom and hunches than data.

To investigate how the well-known Bessel sum approach using pulsed insonification in the nearfield works, we introduce an extension of the sum coarray. This coarray accounts for the dithering, or shot-to-shot variation in the transmit and receive delays that are added to any beamsteering and focusing delays to effect the synthesis. We observe that an arbitrary configuration of the extended coarray can always be implemented using N-squared data, but that the reconstruction algorithm from such data requires the addition of multiple, shifted versions of each transmit/receive element pair data record, which is an extension of the standard reconstruction approach. In order to produce a design that can be implemented as a small number of whole-array transmissions, we structure the array dither in a way that mimics the dither applied to produce Bessel beams, but with greater freedom in the configuration. This approach, with peak PSF sidelobes minimized by simulated annealing, is shown to produce lower sidelobe PSFs than Bessel synthesis designed by existing methods.","1051-0117;10510117","978-1-4577-1253-1;9781457712531","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2011.0281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6293611","Coarray;Forward-looking Ring Array;Synthetic Aperture Ultrasound Imaging","Acoustics;Apertures;Approximation methods;Arrays;Delay;Imaging;Narrowband","biomedical ultrasonics;ultrasonic arrays","Bessel beams;Bessel sum approach;N-squared data;PSF sidelobes;beamsteering;delay dithering;focusing delays;forward-looking ring array;pulsed insonification;reconstruction algorithm;ring array PSF synthesis;shot-to-shot variation;simulated annealing;standard reconstruction approach;sum coarray;synthetic aperture acoustic imaging;transmit-receive element pair data record;whole-array transmissions","","1","","8","","","18-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results suggested that the RW irrigation increased the bacterial diversity. There were 52 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the RW-irrigated sample, whereas only 38 in the control, an increase of 36.8%. While the RW-irrigated sample had 63.5% rare OTUs and 1.9% the most abundant OTUs, the control had 57.9% and 7.9% respectively. Due to a special OTUs distribution pattern, none of the five species abundance models fit the OTU abundance distribution of the RW-irrigated sample, while the log normal models fit the the control sample. The richness index seemed to be very useful for analyzing the shift of bacterial community influenced by RW irrigation. The Shannon-Weaner index and the Shannon-Weaner evenness values might be inapplicable to the microbial community.

When a computer is subject to forensic examination, information may be found that cannot be readily ascribed to a specific user. Such information is typically not located in a specific file or directory, but is found through file carving, which recovers data from unallocated disk sectors. Because the data is carved, it does not have associated file system metadata, and its owner cannot be readily ascertained. The technique presented in this paper starts by automatically recovering both file system metadata as well as extended metadata embedded in files (for instance, embedded timestamps) directly from a disk image. This metadata is then used to find exemplars and to create a machine learning classifier that can be used to ascertain the likely owner of the carved data. The resulting classifier is well suited for use in a legal setting since the accuracy can be easily verified using cross-validation. Our technique also results in a classifier that is easily validated by manual inspection. We report results of the technique applied to both specific hard drive data created in our laboratory and multiuser drives that we acquired on the secondary market. We also present a tool set that automatically creates the classifier and performs validation.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2060484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5518429","Data mining;forensics;information security","Disk drives;Educational institutions;File systems;Forensics;Inspection;Law;Legal factors;Machine learning;Manuals;Permission","computer forensics;data handling;file organisation;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;pattern classification;storage management","associated file system metadata;disk drives;disk image;file carving;forensic examination;machine learning classifier;multiuser carved data ascription problem;storage media;unallocated disk sectors","","2","","20","","2010-07-23","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We face this issue, proposing a computational framework which is based on an expressive descriptor, the covariance of features. Covariances have been employed for pedestrian detection purposes, actually a binary classification problem on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we show how to extend to the multiclassification case, presenting a novel descriptor, named weighted array of covariances, especially suited for dealing with tiny image representations. The extension requires a novel differential geometry approach in which covariances are projected on a unique tangent space where standard machine learning techniques can be applied. In particular, we adopt the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff expansion as a means to approximate on the tangent space the genuine (geodesic) distances on the manifold in a very efficient way.

Such meta-level tuning of adaptive processes is the major challenge in bringing intelligent agents to real-world applications.

These debates have now developed to the extent that a remarkable movement to establish regulations for the removal of Pb has emerged, especially in European countries and Japan. Therefore, many studies are aggressively being undertaken to develop technologies for replacing Sn-Pb solder with a lead-free alternative. From the results obtained so far, it has been proven that the fatigue strength in lead-free solder joints is almost equivalent to the fatigue strength of Sn-Pb eutectic solder joints. However, the other problem is that voids are easily formed in lead-free solder joints during the reflow process, and the effects of void formation on the fatigue strength of solder joints have attracted attention. In this study, the relationship between formation of voids and fatigue fracture mode and fatigue strength of solder joints was examined using FEM (finite element method) analysis and mechanical shear fatigue test. From the results of FEM analysis, it has been found that the equivalent plastic strain and shear strain of solder joints with voids are not always larger than those of solder joints without voids and the magnitude of the strains relate to the position and size of voids in solder joints. However, the difference of the strains is not so great as to affect the fatigue strength of solder joints. It has also been proven from the mechanical shear fatigue test that the fatigue fracture mode of solder joints with voids is similar to that of solder joints without voids and fatigue strength in both cases is also almost equivalent.","","0-7803-8357-5;0780383575","","10.1109/ITHERM.2004.1318300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318300","","Capacitive sensors;Computer industry;Electronics industry;Environmental factors;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Fatigue;Lead;Soldering;Telephony;Testing","circuit reliability;copper alloys;eutectic alloys;fatigue testing;finite element analysis;lead alloys;plastic deformation;reflow soldering;shear deformation;silver alloys;solders;tin alloys;voids (solid)","FEM;SnAgCu;SnPb;fatigue fracture mode;fatigue strength;finite element method;lead free solder joint;mechanical shear fatigue test;plastic strain;reflow process;shear strain;thermal fatigue reliability;void formation","","8","","4","","","1-4 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze RP-based approximations of convex programs, in which the original optimization problem is approximated by the solution of a lower-dimensional problem. Such dimensionality reduction is essential in computation and memory limited settings, since the complexity of general convex programming can be quite high (e.g., cubic for quadratic programs, and substantially higher for semidefinite programs). We prove that the approximation ratio of this procedure can be bounded in terms of the geometry of constraint set. When using Gaussian random projections, the data matrix defining the cost function can be projected down to the statistical dimension of the tangent cone of the constraints at the original solution, which is often substantially smaller than the original dimension. We illustrate consequences of our theory for various cases, including unconstrained and ℓ<sub>1</sub>-constrained least squares, support vector machines and discuss connections with denoising and compressed sensing.","2157-8095;21578095","","","10.1109/ISIT.2014.6874967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6874967","","Geometry;Information theory;Least squares approximations;Noise reduction;Support vector machines;Vectors","Gaussian processes;approximation theory;convex programming;least mean squares methods","ℓ1-constrained least squares;Gaussian random projections;RP-based approximations;compressed sensing;computational cost;cost function;denoising;dimensionality reduction;general convex programming;memory limited settings;optimization problem;sharp guarantees;statistical dimension;storage cost;support vector machines;tangent cone","","1","","18","","","June 29 2014-July 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we show that a weighted linear estimator can well approximate the nonlinear estimator and thus can be used to analyze the statistical properties of the nonlinear estimator. Furthermore, to account for the fact that the ground truth of the ADC is a distribution instead of a single value, a weighted coefficient of variance (COV) is proposed as a criteria to be minimized for the determination of the optimal diffusion weighting factors.

Since traffic surveillance is widely applied, we want to design a single system that can be reused for various traffic surveillance applications. Scene understanding provides contextual information, which improves object detection and can be further used for other applications in a traffic surveillance system. Our framework consists of two main stages: Semantic Hypothesis Generation (SHG) and Context-Based Hypothesis Verification (CBHV). In the SHG stage, a semantic region labeling engine and an appearance-based detector jointly generate the visual regions with specific features or of specific interests. The regions may also contain objects of interest, either moving or static. In the CBHV stage, a cascaded verification is performed to refine the results and smooth the detection by temporal filtering. We model the context by jointly considering spatial and scale constraints and motion saliency. Our proposed framework is validated on real-life road surveillance videos, in which objects-of-interest are moving vehicles. The results of the obtained vehicle detection outperform a recent object detection algorithm, in both precision (92.7%) and recall (92.0%). The framework is both conceptually and in the applied techniques of a generic nature and can be reused in various traffic surveillance applications, that operate, e.g. on a road crossing or in a harbor.","","","","10.1109/AVSS.2014.6918657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918657","","Context;Detectors;Feature extraction;Roads;Semantics;Surveillance;Vehicles","object detection;traffic engineering computing;video surveillance","CBHV;SHG;appearance-based detector;context-based hypothesis verification;context-based object-of-interest detection;contextual information;generic traffic surveillance video analysis system;motion saliency;moving object-of-interest detection;moving vehicles;object detection algorithm;real-life road surveillance videos;scene understanding;semantic hypothesis generation;semantic region labeling engine;temporal filtering;traffic surveillance applications;vehicle detection","","0","","15","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore one need not input any a priori information about these diseases. For input data the authors used 7 parameters calculated by 5 regions of interest (ROIs) in each image. They are variance of pixel values in an ROI, coefficient of variation, annular Fourier power spectrum, longitudinal Fourier power spectrum, and variation of the means of the 5 ROIs. In addition, the authors used 2 more parameters calculated from a co-occurrence matrix of pixel values in an ROI.

"An Ensemble Method for Classifying Startle Eyeblink Modulation from High-Speed Video Records","R. Derakhshani; C.

However, eyeblink is usually measured using intrusive contact electromyographic (EMG) electrodes, accompanied by a laborious manual process of feature extraction. We introduce a new noninvasive automatic system using high-speed video recording of startle blinks in conjunction with data-driven feature selection and support vector machine (SVM) ensembles to classify startle eyeblinks. Using a prestimulus (prepulse) to produce robust modulation of acoustically elicited startle eyeblinks, we tracked the blinks using 250 frames per second video, and extracted different features from eyelid displacement and velocity signals. The SVMs were able to determine whether a trial had contained startle or prepulse+startle stimuli with an accuracy of up to 73 percent (five-fold cross validation). By fusing the decisions made on different feature sets, an ensemble of seven SVMs increased this rate to almost 79 percent. Since startle eyeblinks are robustly modulated by not only sensory events (such as the prepulse used in this study) but also affective and cognitive states, eyelid tracking using high-speed video, in conjunction with the introduced classification method, is an effective and user-friendly alternative to EMG for classification of startle blinks to infer users' affective-cognitive states.","1949-3045;19493045","","","10.1109/T-AFFC.2010.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5661766","Affective computing;image processing;pattern recognition;user interfaces.","Classification;Frequency modulation;Image processing;Pattern recognition;User interfaces","electromyography;feature extraction;medical image processing;support vector machines;video recording","EMG;SVM;affective processing;attentional processing;cognitive processing;ensemble method;five-fold cross validation;high-speed video records;intrusive contact electromyographic electrodes;psychophysiological measurements;sensory processing;startle eyeblink modulation;support vector machine","","0","","79","","2010-12-10","Jan.-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Litton EDD is developing a new class of PPM-focused, narrowband, high average power, millimeter-wave TWTs that utilize a novel integral-polepiece folded-waveguide circuit. The first of these TWTs produced over 250 watts of average power at Ka-band despite construction errors that degraded tube performance. This paper describes the third of such tubes built and tested under Litton's internal research and development program. This TWT is similar to that mentioned above in several ways. They both utilize 20 kV 0.75 A beams formed with a beam convergence of only 36 to minimize beam thermal effects. They both have gain levels of 10 dB/inch, bandwidths of about 350 MHz at Ka-band, and peak power levels between 800 and 1400 watts. However, additional development has resulted in significantly improved performance. By improving the beam optics, the DC transmission was raised above 99% and the minimum RF transmission raised above 98%. By increasing the depression of the single stage collector, the total efficiency was raised to values between 20% and 28%. By increasing the duty to 75%, average output powers were raised above one kilowatt.

For any targeted H-ARQ link outage probability, we find the sequence of power values that minimizes the average total expended transmission power. We first derive a set of equations that describe the optimal transmission power assignment and enable its exact recursive calculation. To reduce calculation complexity, we also develop an approximation to the optimal power sequence that is close to the numerically calculated exact result. The newly founded power allocation solution reveals that conventional equal-power H-ARQ assignment is far from optimal. For example, for targeted outage probability of 10<sup>-3</sup> with a maximum of two transmissions, the average total transmission power with the optimal assignment is 9 dB lower than the equal-power protocol. The difference in average total power cost grows further when the number of allowable retransmissions increases (for example, 11 dB gain with a cap of 5 transmissions) or the targeted outage probability decreases (27 dB gain with outage probability 10<sup>-5</sup> and transmissions capped at 5). Interestingly, the optimal transmission power assignment sequence is neither increasing nor decreasing; its form depends on given total power budget and targeted outage performance levels. Extensive numerical and simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical development.","0090-6778;00906778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2011.050911.090796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771499","Hybrid automatic-repeat-request (H-ARQ) protocol;Rayleigh fading;optimum power allocation;outage probability","Automatic repeat request;Mathematical model;Protocols;Rayleigh channels;Receivers;Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels;automatic repeat request;communication complexity;probability;radio links","H-ARQ communication;H-ARQ link outage probability;average total transmission power;calculation complexity;hybrid automatic-repeat-request;hybrid-ARQ Rayleigh fading link;optimal power assignment sequence;optimal transmission power assignment;power allocation;power value sequence;quasistatic Rayleigh fading channel","","25","","15","","2011-05-19","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To effectively model three-dimensional fringe components in the capacitance model, we propose a novel concept of effective width for a 3D wire, which provides a physics-based approach to decompose any 3D structure into a series of 2D segments. To construct analytic and hierarchical model of loop inductance, an effective loop inductance approach is studied. In particular, we show empirically that high-frequency signal propagating through random signal lines can be approximated by a quasi-TEM mode relationship, leading to a simple way to extract the high-frequency inductance. The capacitance and inductance models are combined into a unified frequency-dependent RLC model describing successfully the wide-band characteristics of on-chip interconnects up to 100GHz. Non-orthogonal wire architecture is also investigated and included in the proposed model. Regarding coupled wire, the impact of resistance matrix on crosstalk noise is studied. The off-diagonal terms of resistance matrix are related to return path, which is important for accurate noise modeling at high frequency. It is shown that the error in crosstalk peak noise can be significant if the return path resistance is ignored.","","0-7803-8511-X;078038511X","","10.1109/ICSICT.2004.1436681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436681","","CMOS technology;Capacitance;Crosstalk;Frequency;Geometry;Inductance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Low-frequency noise;Solid modeling;Wire","capacitance;crosstalk;inductance;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;signal processing;system-on-chip;transmission electron microscopy","100 GHz;3D wire;compact unified model;coupled wire;crosstalk noise;fringe components;high-frequency inductance;loop inductance model;noise modeling;nonorthogonal wire architecture;on-chip interconnects;quasi-3D capacitance model;quasi-TEM;random signal lines;resistance matrix;return path resistance;unified frequency-dependent RLC model","","0","","15","","","18-21 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Improving the DAC Architecture by Using Proprioceptive Sensors","R. Pfeifer; B. Blumberg; J. A. Meyer; S. W. Wilson","","From Animals to Animats 5:Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior","20121008","1998","","","331","339","Previous research has proposed the distributed adaptive control (DAC) architecture as a self-organizing controller for autonomous mobile robots. Despite its successes, practical experience has indicated several options for improvement. This paper proposes a new control architecture for mobile robots that can be seen as an extension of the DAC architecture. The control architecture consists of a controller and a value system. The controller uses the activity patterns of visual sensors to determine the motor commands, whereas the value system receives stimuli from proprioceptive sensors. This design decision is justified by the following arguments: (1) both components are significantly decoupled by using different sensory modalities; (2) the feedback of proprioceptive sensory patterns is omnipresent in biological systems and has been widely neglected in control systems; and (3) proprioceptive sensors operate more reliably and can be used more efficiently than visual sensors, such as pixels in CCD camera. Practical experiments with the Khepera robot show that by using proprioceptive sensors, the control architecture considerably better adapts to changing environments and that it yields very robust behavior with respect to sensor failures.","","9780262291385","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6278726.pdf&bkn=6267521&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","1998","","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

Mixing these lines can result in the laser beam featured by a wide band of colors, including white color. The radio-frequency discharge, that excited the He-Cd mixture inside an alumina ceramic tube (400 mm length and 4 mm inner diameter) inserted into the fused silica tubing, operated between 400 mm long and 4 mm wide outer electrodes. Transformation of the radio-frequency discharge impedance to the 50-Ω output resistance of the radiofrequency generator and symmetrization of the radio-frequency voltage were performed by a special matching circuit. Under single-line operation the He-Cd<sup>+</sup> laser output powers of 60 mW, 38 mW and 14 mW were obtained for the blue, green and red lines, respectively, at an input radio-frequency power of 400 W. Owing to the power interaction between the laser oscillations at red and green higher laser output powers in red and green are possible under multi-line operation. At optimum conditions the white-light laser output power of about 60 mW is obtainable from the laser tube of 40 cm active length. The rms noise-to-signal ratio (lower than 0.4%) of the laser output power of the radio-frequency excited He-Cd<sup>+</sup> laser was comparable to that of hollow cathode He-Cd<sup>+</sup> lasers and much lower than that of conventional positive column He-Cd<sup>+</sup> lasers.

The influence of geometric parameters of the magnetic system and of the physical properties of magnetic fluids on the efficiency of the seal operation has been defined in the temperature range from -50 to +150°C. The development of powerful cryoturbogenerators (CTG) is greatly dependent on the successive realization of hyper- or superconducting inductors (rotors), and minimization of the external heat fluxes to maintain the required temperature there. The heat insulation is mainly produced by high-vacuum, which in most CTG is made as a sealed chamber rotating together with the rotor. In any closed chamber, however, and especially in a chamber with a great number of welds and other connections, which is typical for any real CTG rotor, after switching off the pumping system the pressure gradually increases due to both the gas desorption from the surface of components and the external gas diffusion. Therefore active vacuum control cannot be performed without stopping the rotor.","0018-9464;00189464","","","10.1109/TMAG.1980.1060628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1060628","","Cryogenics;Inductors;Insulation;Magnetic liquids;Magnetic properties;Seals;Superconducting magnets;Temperature dependence;Temperature distribution;Welding","","Cryogenic materials/devices;Magnetic liquids;Seals;Superconducting rotating machines;Turbogenerators;Vacuum systems","","1","","5","","","Mar 1980","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

(1989) showed that the lips carry more than half the visual information provided by the whole face of an English speaker, and that vision of the teeth somewhat increases the intelligibility of a message. Similar experiments have been carried out at the Institut de la Communication Parle´e in French. We compared the overall performance of normal hearers in audio-visual intelligibility tests where the visual displays were made of a natural face (Benoit et al., 1992), natural lips alone (Le Goff et al., 1995), and a bunch of 3D parametric models of the main components of a speaker's face: the lips, the jaw and the skin (Guiard-Marigny et al., 1995).

It is often perceived as a group effort, where content authors, instructional designers, multimedia technicians, teachers, trainers, database administrators, and people from various other areas of expertise come together in order to serve a community of learners. In a typical e-learning scenario, many of the activities can be perceived and modeled as processes and consequently be executed as workflows; there are even prototypical system developments that are experimenting with this approach. On the other hand, there are increasingly many activities, which aim at providing services of any kind on the Web; these can occur as business-to-business or as business-to-consumer services and are generally subsumed under the term Web services. In this paper we suggest to combine the areas of e-learning and Web services, by providing electronic learning offerings as (individual or collections of) Web services as well. We elaborate on this by showing how content providers and content consumers (i.e., learners) can communicate appropriately through a Web service platform with its common description, publication, and retrieval functionalities.

The blade and spar are of composite material. The Finite element modal analysis of designed blade is done in ABAQUS. The scope of the present work is to investigate the structural modal analysis of full-scale 48m fiberglass composite wind turbine blades for 5MW horizontal axis wind turbine and through this to assess the potential for materials savings and consequent reductions of the rotor weight. The entire wind turbine can benefit from such weight reductions through decreased dynamics loads and thus leave room for further optimization. A numerical work has been used to address the most adequate spar shape and to get an understanding of the complex structural behavior of wind turbine blades. Five different types of structural reinforcements helping to prevent undesired structural elastic mechanisms are presented. Comparisons of the eigenfrequencies observed in the full-scale tests are presented and conclusions are drawn based on the mechanisms found.","2155-5516;21555516","","","10.1109/PowerEng.2013.6635748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6635748","Marine renewable energy;composites;effect of spar cross section;modal analysis;wind turbine blade","Aerodynamics;Blades;Computational modeling;Finite element analysis;Materials;Rotors;Wind turbines","finite element analysis;modal analysis;rotors;wind turbines","ABAQUS;composite wind turbine blade:;fiberglass composite wind turbine blades;finite element modal analysis;materials savings;power 5 MW;rotor weight;size 48 m;spars cross-section design effect;structural modal analysis;wind energy sector","","0","","8","","","13-17 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rest of the neurons are initialized using the smallest principal component of the input image. Namely, standard SOFM is applied to the projection of the input image pixels onto the plane spanned by the two largest principal components and to pixels of the original image defined by the smallest principal component.

Here is presented a noninvasive brain imaging device made of two identical ""twin"" linear arrays located on each side of the skull. It is shown how to separate the respective influence of the two bone windows on the path of an ultrasonic wave going from one array to the other, and estimate at each frequency the attenuation and phase shift locally induced by each of the bone windows. This information is then used to correct, for a wide band signal, the wave fronts that have to be sent through the skull in order to obtain a good focusing inside the skull. Compared to uncorrected wave fronts, the spatial shift of the focal point is cancelled, the width of the focal spot is reduced, and sidelobe levels are decreased up to 10 dB. Simulated structural transcranial images of a brain model are presented to exhibit the improvement in image quality provided by this new noninvasive adaptive focusing method.","1051-0117;10510117","0-7803-8412-1;0780384121","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2004.1417709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1417709","","Adaptive arrays;Bones;Brain;Focusing;Frequency estimation;High-resolution imaging;Image resolution;Phased arrays;Skull;Ultrasonic imaging","biomedical ultrasonics;bone;brain;medical image processing;ultrasonic absorption;ultrasonic focusing;ultrasonic refraction","bone window locally induced phase shift;high resolution ultrasonic brain imaging;image quality;noninvasive adaptive focusing;skull bone defocusing effect;spatio temporal inverse filter;transcranial imaging;twin linear arrays;ultrasonic absorption;ultrasonic attenuation;ultrasonic diffusion;ultrasonic refraction","","0","","13","","","23-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main design challenges of endoscopy capsule are accruing and transmitting acceptable quality images by utilizing as less hardware and battery power as possible. In order to save wireless transmission power and bandwidth, an efficient image compression algorithm needs to be implemented inside the endoscopy electronic capsule. In this paper, an integer discrete-cosine-transform (DCT) based algorithm is presented that works on a low-complexity color-space specially designed for wireless capsule endoscopy application. First of all, thousands of human endoscopic images and video frames have been analyzed to identify special intestinal features present in those frames. Then a color space, referred as YEF, is used. The YEF converter is lossless and takes only a few adders and shift operation to implement. A low-cost quantization scheme with variable chroma sub-sampling options is also implemented to achieve higher compression. Comparing with the existing works, the proposed transform coding based compressor performs strongly with an average compression ratio of 85% and a high image quality index, peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 52 dB.","1094-687X;1094687X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944118","","Algorithm design and analysis;Endoscopes;Image coding;Image color analysis;Image reconstruction;PSNR;Wireless communication","biological organs;biomedical optical imaging;discrete cosine transforms;endoscopes;feature extraction;image denoising;image sampling;medical image processing;video coding","battery power;endoscopy electronic capsule;hardware;human endoscopic images;image compression algorithm;image quality index;improved YEF-DCT based compression algorithm;integer discrete cosine-transform-based algorithm;low-complexity color-space;low-cost quantization scheme;medical diagnostics;noninvasive technique;peak-signal-to-noise ratio;special intestinal features;transform coding-based compressor;variable chroma subsampling options;video capsule endoscopy;video frames;wireless capsule endoscopy application;wireless transmission power","","0","","15","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is especially true for diesel engines in which up to 50% of the exhaust gas is recirculated back into the engine. This work presents an estimation algorithm for the oxygen concentration in the intake manifold of a turbocharged diesel engine. The only quantities needed for the estimation scheme are boost pressure, fueling rate, engine speed and EGR valve lift, all of which are generally known to the engine control unit. This estimator is a first order linear dynamic model (with time varying coefficients) and asymptotically stable. Due to the unobservability of the oxygen concentration model, the speed of convergence of the estimation scheme is fixed by engine parameters, but is as fast as the phenomenon of mixing of the exhaust gas recirculated with the air in the intake manifold.

To solve the problem, a combined approach for skew correction of vehicle license plates (VLP) is proposed which is based on Harris corner detector and principal component analysis (PCA). First, corner points are extracted as features using Harris corner detector. PCA is applied onto these features to find out the principal component in the direction of maximum eigen value. This principal component reflects the skew angle of the plate. Then skew correction of the plate is accomplished. Main advantage of the proposed method is, it is very simple in the skew correction of VLP images and gives accurate results.","","978-1-4577-0543-4;9781457705434","978-0-7695-4437-3;9780769544373","10.1109/CSNT.2011.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5966465","Harris corner detector;PCA;feature point;skew correction","Detectors;Feature extraction;Licenses;Pixel;Principal component analysis;Transforms;Vehicles","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;image segmentation;principal component analysis","ALPR system;Harris corner feature;PCA;VLP images;automatic license plate recognition system;character segmentation;maximum eigen value;principal component analysis;skew correction;vehicle license plate","","3","","16","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analyses of the information contained in these data sets have already led to a major challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) theory is a new sampling framework that provides an alternative to the well-known Shannon sampling theory. This theory enables the recovery of sparse or compressible signals from a small set of nonadaptive, linear measurements. However, it is suboptimal to recover full signal from the compressive measurements and then solve feature identification problems through traditional DSP techniques. Thus, a novel mechanical feature identification method is proposed in this paper. Its main advantage is that fault features are extracted directly in the compressive measurement domain without sacrificing accuracy. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the measurement data is achieved and the computational efficiency is improved dramatically. Numerical simulations and experiment are performed to prove the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method.","1091-5281;10915281","","","10.1109/I2MTC.2015.7151334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7151334","compressive measurements;compressive sensing;feature identification;machine fault diagnosis","Fault diagnosis;Feature extraction;Frequency measurement;Noise;Pollution measurement;Sensors;Vibrations","compressed sensing;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;numerical analysis;reliability;signal sampling","CS theory;DSP technique;Shannon sampling theory;complex mechanical system;compressed sensing theory;compressible signal;compressive measurement domain;fault feature extraction;feature identification problem;machine fault diagnosis;nonadaptive linear measurement;numerical simulation;reliability","","1","","18","","","11-14 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The VCO is based on an on-chip symmetrical spiral inductor and a differential varactor. The 2.5-GHz quadrature LO signals are generated using the injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) technique. The ILFD structure is similar to the VCO structure with its wide tracking range. The design tool ASITIC was used to optimize all on-chip symmetrical inductors. The power consumption was kept low with differential LC tanks and the ILFD technique. The circuit was implemented in a 0. 18−μm CMOS process. Hspice and SpectreRF simulations show the proposed circuit could generate low phase noise 5/2.5-GHz dual band LO signals with a wide tuning range. The 2.5-GHz LO signals are quadrature with almost no phase and amplitude errors. The circuit consumes less than 5. 3 mW in the tuning range with a power supply voltage of 1.5 V. The die area is only 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6074198","injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD);voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO);wireless local area network (WLAN) transceivers","CMOS integrated circuits;Inductors;Phase noise;Transceivers;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Wireless LAN;Yarn","","","","0","","","","","April 2003","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The REDB data model involves observation data, learning set data, views definitions, and a regression model instance. The observation data is a collection of relational tuples over a set of attributes; the learning data set involves a subset of observation tuples, augmented with learned attributes, which are modeled as random variables; the views are expressed as linear combinations of observation and learned attributes; and the regression model involves functions that map observation tuples to probability distributions of the random variables, which are learned dynamically from the learning data set. The REDB query language extends relational algebra project-select queries with conditions on probabilities of first-order logical expressions, which in turn involve linear combinations of learned attributes and views, and arithmetic comparison operators. Such capability relies on the underlying regression model for the learned attributes. We show that REDB queries are computable by developing conceptual evaluation algorithms and by proving their correctness and termination","","0-7695-2735-3;0769527353","","10.1109/ICMLA.2006.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041480","","Algebra;Arithmetic;Data models;Database languages;Decision making;Probability distribution;Random variables;Relational databases;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Uncertainty","data models;probability;query languages;query processing;regression analysis;relational algebra;relational databases;set theory","conceptual evaluation algorithm;probabilistic query;probability distributions;query language;regression database data model;relational algebra;sparse learning set","","4","","9","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, neurological findings on brain connectivity are one of the interesting issues. However, in spite of the effort to study the brain connectivity by the neuroscientists and engineers, a large part of brain functions are unknown. Among them, the consciousness mechanism in the anesthesia is one hot topic in the medical fields. Although the many researchers investigate the mechanism of loss of consciousness (LOC), the feasible cause for that phenomenon is unknown. In order to evaluate the state of unconsciousness by the anesthesia, the analysis of the brain connectivity is needed. The Granger causality (GC) is one of the algorithms for extracting brain connectivity using electroencephalogram (EEG). It indicates the information flows between two different brain regions whether they are connected physically or not. In this paper, we investigate brain connectivity which is based on the GC between the brain regions of rats depending on concentration levels of isoflurane that is widely used for inhalation anesthetic in human medicine.","2093-7121;20937121","","","10.1109/ICCAS.2015.7364940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364940","Granger causality (GC);anesthesia;electroencephalogram (EEG);isoflurane;loss of consciousness (LOC)","Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Radio frequency;Silicon carbide","drugs;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","EEG;GC;Granger causality;LOC;anesthesia;brain connectivity;brain functions;brain region;consciousness mechanism;electroencephalogram;human medicine;information flows;inhalation anesthetic;isoflurane concentration levels;loss of consciousness;rat study;signal processing technology","","","","6","","","13-16 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two figures of merit are investigated for space-time code (STC) optimization under a semidefinite rank constraint: 1) the lower Chernoff bound (LCB) to the detection probability for fixed probability of false alarm, and 2) the mutual information (MI) between the observations available at the receive nodes and the “channel response” generated by a point-like target, assumed present tout court. Both receive and transmit power constraints are discussed. If the scattering distribution possesses some suitably defined properties of unitary invariance (see ????? ), both MI-optimal and LCB-optimal STCs have a simple canonical structure: the same set of (clutter dependant) temporal codewords are employed at the transmit nodes, the only difference among the many solutions being the amount of power radiated by each antenna. Such a spatial power allocation critically depends upon the adopted figure of merit, the specified power constraint, and the underlying scattering model. Sufficient conditions to determine the optimal power allocation for all design criteria are provided. Asymptotic power distributions are also derived in the limit of vanishingly small and increasingly large signal-to-clutter ratios, proving that assuming Gaussian scattering at the design stage is a robust choice. A case study of relevant practical interest is examined in depth so as to compare the proposed design criteria and to assess the impact of signal non-Gaussianity on the system performances.","0018-9448;00189448","","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2068930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5605365","Angle diversity;energy integration;generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT);lower Chernoff bound;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) detection;mutual information (MI);non-Gaussian target scattering;space-time coding;waveform design","Clutter;Encoding;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Scattering;Signal to noise ratio;Transmitting antennas","MIMO communication;electromagnetic wave scattering;space-time codes","MIMO detection;channel response;generalized likelihood ratio test;lower Chernoff bound;multiple-input-multiple-output detection;mutual information;non-Gaussian target scattering;receive antennas;scattering distribution;space-time code;transmit antennas","","13","","33","","","Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Memory effects in a communication system arise from several sources. In power amplifier circuits, memory effects are caused by DC supply voltage circuits, matching networks and power devices (transistors). Memory effects of power devices are required to be described accurately by the device model, since these effects can have significant impacts on output power, efficiency and linearity of the circuit.

The other method increases the matching SNR to 4.5 times greater than previous methods using peak sharpening of the matching degree curve.

Video encoders adapt QPs of coding blocks for visual quality optimization and rate control. Although they send only delta QPs (dQPs) obtained by causal prediction, the side information overhead is expensive. Therefore the HEVC design necessitates an efficient dQP coding. The proposed scheme converts a dQP to a binary string in which the first and second bins indicate the significance and sign of the dQP respectively and the rest represents the magnitude minus 1. Furthermore, it detects and truncates redundant bins in the binary strings by using the sign and an admissible dQP range. Thus it reduces the length of dQP binary strings and improves dQP coding efficiency. Simulation results using HEVC reference software demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the dQP coding efficiency by 6% while reducing its bin rates by 25%.","","978-1-4673-4570-5;9781467345705","978-1-4673-4571-2;9781467345712","10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6343414","","Collaboration;Context;Encoding;Joints;Quantization;Software;Video coding","image representation;optimisation;quantisation (signal);video coding","HEVC design;bin rate;binary representation;causal prediction;coding block;dQP binary string;dQP coding efficiency;delta QP;delta quantization parameter;high efficiency video coding;information overhead;rate control;video encoder;visual quality optimization","","0","","13","","","17-19 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on assumed transmitter knowledge of the channel fading, the proposed schemes adaptively select the signal constellation.

The experiment covered the whole growth period of maize plants in order to observe directional brightness temperature (TBD) variations of row structure canopy as a function of measuring time and date. The TBD was extracted from thermal infrared (TIR) images captured by a TIR camera mounted upon a crane. The results show that TBD were highly date and time specific. Comparing the variations of DBT near the noontime with different biomass, the measurements over a middle dense canopy revealed an evident row-direction-oriented hot stripe in the DBT polar map, where a hot spot appeared along the solar direction. Similarly, for a low cover condition, a wider hot stripe appeared in the polar map, the hottest area in the band is around the solar position. However, for a high biomass condition when the field was nearly wholly covered by the leaves, the lowest temperature appeared along the row direction, which formed a cool strip in the polar map. Comparing the variations of DBT on the same day, for a measurement over middle dense canopy, in the morning and afternoon, with a large solar zenith, the range of DBT variation decreased, hot strip features weakened and turned wider, solar position was out of the hot strip. As a conclusion of the field experiment, the maize TBD feature is dominated by sun-sensor geometry, complex effects of canopy structures coupled with spatial distributions of canopy brightness temperatures. A row structure effect appeared clearly in the TBD polar map throughout the whole measurement. Quantitative explanations are expected in further research on the physical models.","","0-7803-7929-2;0780379292","","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294397","","Biomass;Brightness temperature;Cameras;Cranes;Geometry;Infrared imaging;Remote sensing;Strips;Sun;Time measurement","agriculture;vegetation mapping","AD 1999 05 to 08;INRA Avignon branch;Sun-sensor geometry;directional brightness temperature variation;hot stripe;maize canopy;maize plant;middle dense canopy;polar map;row structure canopy;row structure effect;solar position;solar zenith angle;southern France;spatial distributions;temporal variations;thermal infrared camera;thermal infrared image","","0","","5","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, pixels belonging to such ribbons are fitted by conic splines, and then a graph is constructed whose nodes are end points of the arcs fitted by the splines. The key new idea is to assign edges between all nodes and label them with a cost function based on physical constraints on roads.

The smart meter is a non-intrusive load monitor (NILM) that measures the active, reactive, and harmonic content of the line current. This information is fed to the dedicated active power filter. The NILM determines the amount of reactive and harmonic current fed to the downstream loads, which may include the current supplied by the active power filter itself. Despite this, the reactive current can be reduced to nearly zero. The active power filter can also be provided with external commands from the grid operator. This scheme is particularly useful in virtual power plant (VPP) applications involving demand dispatch in support of distributed intermittent renewables.

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of the loose coupler concept. We define a loose coupler as an information object design that optimizes data utilization (production and consumption) among a community of independent participants while globally minimizing costs (development and employment). Local efficiencies of point-to-point information design yield to the greater global efficiencies of the information environment in which a loose coupler operates. We investigate data sharing usage patterns and infospace environments within and across communities of interest and use these to identify characteristics of loose coupler design.

Traditional high quality ECG transmission schemes require substantial amounts of energy usage, which may not be available in BASN. Therefore, an adaptive approach is necessary to provide high quality ECG transmission with efficient usage of available energy resources. Related literature mainly focuses on data compression, where transmission energy is saved because the amount of data being transmitted is reduced. However, further reduction of energy consumption based on communication strategy is rarely discussed in literature. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of compressed ECG data, which show that different parts of the data are unequally important to quality of ECG transmission in BASN. In this work, we propose a new Rate-switching Un-Equal Protection (RUEP) mechanism, which optimizes the distortion reduction of ECG data by adaptively assigning different Rate Compatible Punctured Convolutional (RCPC) codes to protect the different parts of the compressed ECG data. Simulation results demonstrate that our RUEP scheme results in an improved communication energy efficiency by at least 45 percent compared with traditional schemes in the AWGN channel.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-8178-1;9781424481781","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680106","Energy efficiency;body area sensor network;electrocardiography;rate-compatible puncture convolutional code;rate-switching un-equal protection","Electrocardiography;Encoding;Energy consumption;Partitioning algorithms;Wavelet transforms;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","AWGN channels;biomedical communication;body area networks;convolutional codes;electrocardiography;wireless sensor networks","AWGN channel;BASN;ECG transmission;data compression;energy consumption reduction;energy efficiency;energy resources;mobile wireless electrocardiography;rate compatible punctured convolutional codes;rate-switching unequal error protection;wireless body area sensor networks;wireless electrocardiogram transmission","","2","","15","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An LMI formulation is derived to obtain gains of state estimator stabilizing the augmented output feedback system with the pre-determined state feedback gains. A receding horizon output feedback control (RHOC) strategy is proposed based on these state feedback and state estimator gains in conjunction with their corresponding periodically invariant sets.

The switched HZ control has two control modes: the hold-control one and the zero-control one. The switch between the two control modes is determined by a switching parameter. In order to obtain an ACMR as high as possible, we put forward a method to optimally design the switching parameter.

To overcome these issues, the proposed algorithm draws upon ideas from recent local warping methods in image stitching and video stabilization. For video frame alignment, we propose spatial-temporal local warping, which locally aligns frames from different videos while maintaining the temporal consistency. For aligned video frame composition, we find stitching seams with 3D graphcut on overlapped spatial-temporal volumes, where the 3D graph is weighted with object and motion saliency to reduce stitching artifacts.

In this paper, we apply and assess the ML approach on real data, acquired with an experimental Ka-band multibaseline system. Compared to simulated data, dealing with real data implies that several calibration steps be carried out to ensure that the data fit the model. A processing chain was, therefore, designed, including steps responsible for compensating for imperfections observed in the data, such as beam elevation angle dependent phase errors or phase errors caused by imperfect motion compensation. The performance of the ML phase estimation was evaluated by comparing it to results based on a coarse-to-fine (C2F) algorithm, where information from the shorter baselines was used only to unwrap the phase from the longest available baseline. For this purpose, flat areas with high coherence and homogeneous texture were selected in the acquired data. The results show that with only four looks, the noise level was marginally better with the C2F approach and contained fewer outliers. However, with more looks, the ML method consistently delivered better results: noise variance with the C2F approach was slightly but steadily larger than the variance obtained with ML method.","1939-1404;19391404","","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2487685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7305787","Interferometry;Ka-band;maximum likelihood (ML);millimeter wave radar;millimeterwave experimental multifrequency polarimetric high-resolution interferometric system (MEMPHIS);multibaseline;phase unwrapping;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Calibration;Maximum likelihood estimation;Motion compensation;Phase estimation;Synthetic aperture radar","airborne radar;image texture;maximum likelihood estimation;millimetre wave radar;motion compensation;phase estimation;radar imaging;radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar","C2F algorithm;ML method;airborne multibaseline SAR interferometry;calibration steps;coarse-to-fine algorithm;cross-track multibaseline synthetic aperture radar interferometric data;experimental Ka-band multibaseline system;homogeneous texture;imperfect motion compensation;maximum likelihood phase estimation method;noise level","","1","","33","","2015-10-26","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This kind of streaming technology is mainly used with HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 respectively, which both have some drawbacks. Therefore, the IETF has started the development of HTTP 2.0, which is based on Google's SPDY proposal and already supported by several major companies, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Akamai, Mozilla and obviously Google. Furthermore, Content Centric Networking (CCN) is another novel approach for future networks that is considered as an revolutionary approach compared to HTTP 2.0. The CCN communication paradigm is completely different and does not rely on direct connections between hosts, it rather focuses on the content. This paper demonstrates DASH with HTTP 2.0/SPDY and CCN using our universal libdash library. Moreover, different mechanisms of DASH will be shown that can be used to provide on-demand and live content in an efficient and comfortable way.","","","","10.1109/ICMEW.2013.6618220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618220","CCN;DASH;HTTP 2.0;SPDY","Internet;Libraries;Media;Multimedia communication;Protocols;Streaming media;Transform coding","IEC standards;ISO standards;hypermedia;multimedia computing;public domain software;software libraries;transport protocols;video coding;video streaming","Akamai;CCN communication paradigm;Facebook;Google SPDY proposal;HTTP 1.0;HTTP 1.1;HTTP 2.0;IETF;ISO/IEC MPEG standard;Libdash;MPEG-DASH standard;Mozilla;Twitter;bandwidth conditions;content centric networking;dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP;heterogeneous end devices;multimedia data;open source software library;streaming technology;universal libdash library","","3","","13","","","15-19 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SPEEDAM 2006.","20060705","2006","","","497","502","An approach to voltage and frequency control for an isolated induction generator (IG) is presented. In the developed approach, constant frequency control is achieved through kinetic energy control by a speed governor while constant voltage control is reached through reactive power control by a voltage-sourced inverter. In order to reach effective frequency control, the relative rotating speed, which is computed from the rate of change of voltage phase angle at generator terminal, is used to estimate the frequency. Constant voltage control is essential for the frequency control, since the random load fluctuation due to bus voltage variations can be eliminated. As a result, the real power unbalance of the IG is minimized and generator speed as well as mechanical power can be more effectively controlled by the frequency controller. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated on a 3 kW experimental set up with an induction generator driven by a servomotor. Disturbances such as step changes in load and frequency reference setting have been considered. The experimental results show that satisfactory dynamic performance of the isolated IG can be achieved by the proposed frequency controller and voltage controller","","1-4244-0193-3;1424401933","","10.1109/SPEEDAM.2006.1649823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1649823","","Fluctuations;Frequency control;Frequency estimation;Induction generators;Inverters;Kinetic energy;Phase estimation;Power generation;Reactive power control;Voltage control","asynchronous generators;frequency control;invertors;machine control;reactive power control;servomotors;voltage control","3 kW;bus voltage variations;constant frequency control;constant voltage control;frequency estimation;frequency reference;isolated induction generator;kinetic energy control;load reference;random load fluctuation;reactive power control;relative rotating speed;servomotor;speed governor;voltage phase angle;voltage-sourced inverter","","6","","10","","","23-26 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear relationships exist between the thermal conductivity and the carbon content, the carbon equivalent, and the fraction of the former primary solidified austenite transformed into pearlite. The results show that the optimal thermal transport properties are obtained at medium cooling rates. Equations are given for the thermal conductivity of pearlite, solidified as pre-eutectic austenite, and the eutectic of grey iron.

In many applications there is motivation to design transducers that operate over a wide bandwidth so that, for example, signals containing a broad frequency content can be received. The device's length scale will dictate the central operating frequency of the device and so, in order to construct a wide bandwidth device, it would seem natural to design a device that contains a range of length scales. The objective of this article therefore is to consider one such transducer design and build a theoretical model to assess its performance. For the composite geometry a fractal medium is chosen as this contains a wide range of length scales. Numerical results of a theoretical model are presented. They suggest that this device would have a three-fold improvement in the reception sensitivity bandwidth as compared to a conventional composite design. Finite-element analysis provides information on the effect of poling on the device's performance.

Secondly these two images are synthesized to form a new one by the information fusion method based on features. The advantage of the method is that value K and the initial clustering centroids are determined automatically according to the image histogram and no need for the rectification of images before the images are fused.

Technical Digest., International","20020806","1997","","","85","88","In devices with p+ gates and p- substrates, two unique conditions exist such that the intrinsic and stress-induced traps can be probed and separated in the direct tunneling current. The first condition is that E/sub F/ is initially below the midgap energy of the Si substrate. The second condition is that V/sub fb/ is near V/sub G/=0. Thus, E/sub F/ probes the trap states as it moves up toward E/sub C/. As a result, the increase in the tunneling current between V/sub fb/ and V/sub th/ (e.g., between V/sub G/=0.2 V and 1 V) is a very sensitive measurement of the intrinsic traps and can be used to qualify the initial quality of the oxides. Also under such conditions, the increase of the leakage current due to stress-induced traps can be clearly studied. Therefore, we propose that devices with p+ gates and p- substrates should be used to unify the characterization of ultrathin oxides. In fabricating dual-gate CMOS circuits, such devices can be made to qualify the oxides on product wafers. According to this study, several characteristics of the intrinsic and stress-induced traps can be concluded. Firstly, the intrinsic traps are fast states, and the stress-induced traps (after certain amount of stress) are mostly slow states. Secondly, the trap-assisted tunneling is an elastic process in the direct tunneling regime before stress. Finally, E/sub tr/, and Q/sub tr/, can be estimated from the direct tunneling current. The differences between intrinsic and stress-induced traps should be considered in developing breakdown models for ultrathin oxides.","0163-1918;01631918","0-7803-4100-7;0780341007","","10.1109/IEDM.1997.649470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=649470","","Capacitance-voltage characteristics;Current measurement;Density measurement;Electric breakdown;Electrodes;Energy measurement;Energy states;Stress measurement;Tunneling;Voltage","CMOS integrated circuits;electron traps;integrated circuit reliability;internal stresses;leakage currents;tunnelling","0.2 to 1 V;2.3 to 3.8 nm;breakdown models;direct tunneling current;dual-gate CMOS circuits;elastic process;intrinsic traps;leakage current;midgap energy;p+ gates;p- substrates;stress-induced traps;trap states;trap-assisted tunneling;tunneling current;ultrathin oxides;unified characterization methodologies","","8","","7","","","10-10 Dec. 1997","07 Dec 1997-10 Dec 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Popular usages of location information include geotagging on social media websites, driver assistance and navigation, and querying nearby locations of interest. However, the average user may not realize the high energy costs of using location services (namely the GPS) or may not make smart decisions regarding when to enable or disable location services - for example, when indoors. As a result, a mechanism that can make these decisions on the user’s behalf can significantly improve a smartphone’s battery life. In this work, we present an energy consumption analysis of the localization methods available on modern Android smartphones and propose the addition of an indoor localization mechanism that can be triggered depending on whether a user is detected to be indoors or outdoors. Based on our energy analysis and implementation of our proposed system, we provide experimental results - monitoring battery life over time - and show that an indoor localization method triggered by indoor or outdoor context can improve smartphone battery life and, potentially, location accuracy.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2553100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7451199","","Androids;Context;Global Positioning System;Humanoid robots;Operating systems;Sensors;Smart phones","","","","","","","","2016-04-12","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

An ubiquitous computing environment supports a busy and mobile user's need of being able to work on his task anytime and anywhere he wants. Along with user's data (his profile, task, and application registry) the machine-acquired intelligence needs to be transported as well in order that the user could continue working on an intelligent environment. Machine intelligence is acquired through incremental learning. In a context-sensitive environment that has a rich selection of modalities and media for data input and output, an intelligent computing system could determine the I/O devices appropriate for the user's setting after considering the user's location, the noise level in the environment, and the presence or absence of other people in the vicinity. Every new setting (pre-condition scenario) produces a new I/O devices configuration (post-condition scenario) suited for the setting; each new scenario knowledge gets stored onto knowledge database. Overtime, the machine would have enough knowledge to deal with whatever context scenario that comes up.","2160-4886;21604886","0-7803-9181-0;0780391810","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512956","","Databases;Decision making;Humans;Learning systems;Multimedia computing;Multimedia systems;Pervasive computing;Productivity;Speech;Ubiquitous computing","learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;ubiquitous computing","context-sensitive incremental learning paradigm;intelligent computing system;machine intelligence;ubiquitous multimodal multimedia computing system","","5","","16","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The MDS problem is formulated as maximization of a correntropy criterion, which is solved by half-quadratic optimization in a multiplicative formulation. By doing so, theMDS copes with an initial dissimilarity matrix contaminated with outliers, because the correntropy criterion is closely related to the Welsch M-estimator. The proposed algorithm is coined as Multiplicative Half-Quadratic MDS (MHQMDS). Its performance is assessed for potential functions associated to various M-estimators have been tested. Three state-of-the-art MDS techniques, namely the Scaling by Majorizing a Complicated Function (SMACOF), the Robust Euclidean Embedding (REE), and the Robust MDS (RMDS), are implemented under the same conditions. The experimental results indicate that the MHQMDS, outperforms the aforementioned state-of-the-art competing techniques.","","","","10.1109/IWBF.2015.7110227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110227","Mestimators;Multidimensional scaling;correntropy;face-pose images;half-quadratic optimization;robustness","Computer integrated manufacturing;Forensics;Measurement;Minimization;Optimization;Robustness;Stress","face recognition;matrix algebra;optimisation;pose estimation","MHQMDS;REE;RMDS;SMACOF;Welsch M-estimator;correntropy based robust multidimensional scaling;correntropy criterion;dissimilarity matrix;face-pose images;half-quadratic optimization;maximization;multiplicative formulation;multiplicative half-quadratic MDS;pair-wise distance;potential function;robust Euclidean embedding;robust MDS;scaling by majorizing a complicated function;two-dimensional embedding","","0","","31","","","3-4 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a conventional ANN, approximates smooth input-output relations or functions of many variables much better than traditional universal approximators like Taylor series or piecewise approximations; however, to cope with even larger systems such as megapixel image recognition or control of electric power grids, it is necessary to move to a family of more complex ANNs such as cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks (CSRN), Object Networks, and networks with object symmetry and small world connectivity, which can be emulated on CNNs.

In order to proceed, the signal from the force sensors (placed underneath each foot) were first divided according to the fundamental period by auto-correlation. This ensures that each period contains a full stance phase and two fragmented swing phases. After this step, Short Time Fourier transform has been performed on each period of the signal to detect the initial search point (highest DC value) on the stance phase. Then by judging the width and slope of the straight line from changing search points on the signal to a changing destination point (starting from the minimum or maximum time value) of the graph the onset and offset of the stance and swing phase has been detected. The changing search point has small distance from the previous one, if the slope of the signal is small, but the distance increases with the increasing change of slope of the signal. The destination point changes with the change of slope of the straight line. This algorithm has been applied to the signals in the database of Parkinsons disease, which shows a success rate of more than 90%.","","978-1-4799-7224-1;9781479972241","","10.1109/ECS.2015.7124944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7124944","Auto-Correlation;Gait cycle;Short Time Fourier Transform","Correlation;Databases;Fourier transforms;Legged locomotion;Parkinson's disease;Phase detection;Time-frequency analysis","Fourier transforms;biomedical equipment;diseases;electrocardiography;force measurement;force sensors;gait analysis;medical signal detection;medical signal processing","Parkinsons disease;database;destination point changes;force sensors;fragmented swing phases;highest DC value;human gait cycle;initial search point;short time Fourier transform;signal detection;stance phase detection algorithm;swing phase detection algorithm","","0","","21","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presented control circuit has the property of selective harmonics elimination and voltage flicker. Via this feature it is possible to separate selected harmonics in the point of common coupling voltage and then eliminate them by making reference voltage. The unique capability of this series active filter is the elimination of voltage flicker in the point of common coupling. It has been created by using the resonant controller. The series active filter is simulated in a typical network and the results shows that this filter reduces the harmonics and eliminates voltage flicker.","","978-1-4673-1418-3;9781467314183","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6254561","Power quality;Series active filter;Voltage flicker;Voltage harmonics","Active filters;Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Transfer functions;Voltage control;Voltage fluctuations","","","","1","","11","","","2-3 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FOCS '09. 50th Annual IEEE Symposium on","20100325","2009","","","495","504","We study the ITEM PRICING problem for revenue maximization in the limited supply setting, where a single seller with n distinct items caters to m buyers with unknown subadditive valuation functions who arrive in a sequence. The seller sets the prices on individual items. Each buyer buys a subset of yet unsold items that maximizes her utility. Our goal is to design pricing strategies that guarantee an expected revenue that is within a small multiplicative factor of the optimal social welfare an upper bound on the maximum revenue that can be generated by any pricing mechanism. Most earlier work has focused on the unlimited supply setting, where selling an item to a buyer does not affect the availability of the item to the future buyers. Recently, Balcan et. al. studied the limited supply setting, giving a randomized pricing strategy that achieves a 2<sup>O(?(log n log log n)</sup>-approximation; their strategy assigns a single price to all items (uniform pricing), and never changes it (static pricing). They also showed that no pricing strategy that is both static and uniform can give better than 2<sup>??(log1/4 n)</sup>-approximation. Our first result is a strengthening of the lower bound on approximation achievable by static uniform pricing to 2<sup>??(log n)</sup>. We then design dynamic uniform pricing strategies (all items are identically priced but item prices can change over time), that achieves O(log<sup>2</sup> n)-approximation, and also show a lower bound of ? ((log n/ log log n)<sup>2</sup>) for this class of strategies. Our strategies are simple to implement, and in particular, one strategy is to smoothly decrease the price over time. We also design a static nonuniform pricing strategy (different items can have different prices but prices do not change over time), that give poly-logarithmic approximation in a more restricted setting with few buyers. Thus in the limited supply setting, our results highlight a strong separation between the power of dynamic an- d non-uniform pricing strategies versus static uniform pricing strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial analysis of dynamic and non-uniform pricing schemes for revenue maximization in a setting with multiple distinct items.","0272-5428;02725428","978-1-4244-5116-6;9781424451166","","10.1109/FOCS.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438605","item pricing;limited supply setting;revenue maximization","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Cost accounting;Information science;Pricing;USA Councils;Upper bound","pricing","item pricing problem;limited supply setting;poly-logarithmic approximation;pricing strategies;revenue maximization","","1","","18","","","25-27 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A method for designing such loops is presented and its use is illustrated by a conceptual design and a numerical example. The second remedy is to adopt a passband equalizer receiver structure.

Eng., Univ. of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","IEEE Transactions on Communications","20140123","2014","62","1","41","58","This paper studies optimum power control and sum-rate scaling laws for the distributed cognitive uplink. It is first shown that the optimum distributed power control policy is in the form of a threshold based water-filling power control. Each secondary user executes the derived power control policy in a distributed fashion by using local knowledge of its direct and interference channel gains such that the resulting aggregate (average) interference does not disrupt primary's communication. Then, the tight sum-rate scaling laws are derived as a function of the number of secondary users N under the optimum distributed power control policy. The fading models considered to derive sum-rate scaling laws are general enough to include Rayleigh, Rician and Nakagami fading models as special cases. When transmissions of secondary users are limited by both transmission and interference power constraints, it is shown that the secondary network sum-rate scales according to 1/en<sub>h</sub> log log (N), where n_h is a parameter obtained from the distribution of direct channel power gains. For the case of transmissions limited only by interference constraints, on the other hand, the secondary network sum-rate scales according to 1/eγ<sub>g</sub> log (N), where γ<sub>g</sub> is a parameter obtained from the distribution of interference channel power gains. These results indicate that the distributed cognitive uplink is able to achieve throughput scaling behavior similar to that of the centralized cognitive uplink up to a pre-log multiplier 1/e, whilst primary's quality-of-service requirements are met. The factor 1/e can be interpreted as the cost of distributed implementation of the cognitive uplink.","0090-6778;00906778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2013.112413.130510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679366","Cognitive radio;distributed algorithms;multiple access channels;power control;throughput scaling","Fading;Interference channels;Power control;Scattering;Throughput;Uplink","Nakagami channels;Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;cognitive radio;probability","Nakagami fading models;Rayleigh fading models;Rician fading models;asymptotic throughput analysis;distributed cognitive uplink;interference channel power gains;interference power constraints;local knowledge;optimum power control;sum-rate scaling laws;threshold based water-filling power control;transmission power constraints","","1","","37","","2013-12-09","January 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then the conditional average of gender wage differentials was decomposed by method of Oaxaca-Blinder. The results show that only 20.24% of the difference can be explained by individual characteristics, the rest 79.76% is unexplainable. At the same time, the coefficient of discrimination is 129%. Such results indicate that the discrimination is the main factor of wage differentials.

Next, the above selected varieties of VLDPE were tested regarding the extruding into cables. The extrusion of VLDPE was found to be more difficult compared to conventional XLPE, and consequently required the modification of extrusion conditions and a crosslinking agent. The result of the water tree acceleration test of XLVLDPE cables indicated that the generation of bow-tie trees was suppressed to a larger extent than conventional XLPE cables. Although the AC initial breakdown voltage of XLVLDPE cables was lower than that of the conventional XLPE cables, there was almost no decrease in the breakdown voltage due to the water tree test and the breakdown voltage became higher than that of the conventional XLPE cables after the water tree tests. The superior water tree retardation characteristics of XLVLDPE described was deduced to be due to the combined effect of the low crystallinity of the base polyethylene and the presence of the additive material (neutralizing agent and antioxidant)","0885-8977;08858977","","","10.1109/61.277728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=277728","","Additives;Crystalline materials;Crystallization;Polyethylene;Polymers;Power cables;Retardants;Semiconductor materials;Testing;Trees - insulation","cable insulation;electric breakdown of solids;insulation testing;life testing;organic insulating materials;power cables","AC initial breakdown voltage;VLDPE;antioxidant;bow-tie trees;crosslinking agent;extrusion conditions modification;low crystallinity;neutralizing agent;very low density polyethylene;water tree acceleration test;water tree retardant XLPE cable","","4","","4","","","Jan 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Spin wave resonance (SWR)-an effect observed in thin ferromagnetic films-is well adapted for such detection. In this paper, we are concerned with the theoretical conditions for surface mode detection in SWR. Since SWR depends essentially on the conditions existing on the surfaces of a film, we begin with a closer analysis of the concept of surface spin pinning. Next, resorting to the Surface Inhomogeneity Model (thin film, totally homogeneous within, but presenting arbitrary asymmetric conditions on its surfaces), we solve the problem of the existence of surface modes as a function of the pinning conditions, and discuss the essential features of these modes. Finally, we propose a criterion for identifying surface peaks in SWR spectra.","0018-9464;00189464","","","10.1109/TMAG.1973.1067561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1067561","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Crystalline materials;Crystallography;Magnetic films;Magnetic materials;Magnetic resonance;Nearest neighbor searches;Stationary state;Surface waves;Transistors","","Ferromagnetic films;Magnetic surface modes;Spin-wave resonance","","0","","21","","","Mar 1973","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Both the controlling techniques are investigated in terms of torque stability and response time. The proposed system is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The performance of the system with these control techniques is investigated under variable wind speed conditions such as small and large duration variations, increase and decrease of wind speed.

As FSS is a recent technique and only output results were investigated so far. This paper analyzes the influence of the FSS operators on the performance of the algorithm in six benchmark functions. We assessed the influence of each swimming operator separately. We found that the volitive mechanism is the operator that affords most of the exploration abilities during the search process. The carried out assessment has also shown that, in average, the best results are obtained only when all the FSS operators are actived. It means that all operators are fairly relevant and complementary. Moreover, we compared FSS results with some PSO variations and showed that FSS outperformed these PSO algorithms in some cases.","1062-922X;1062922X","978-1-4244-2793-2;9781424427932","978-1-4244-2794-9;9781424427949","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346377","Fish School Search;Optimization;Swarm Intelligence","Ant colony optimization;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Evolutionary computation;Frequency selective surfaces;Marine animals;Particle swarm optimization;Performance analysis;Protection;USA Councils","evolutionary computation;search problems","PSO algorithms;evolutionary algorithms;fish school search algorithm;search problems;swarm based algorithms;swimming operators","","2","","7","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute a small set of candidate p-cycles that can lead to good performance when used by ILP or the heuristic algorithm. The key idea of the algorithm is to generate a combination of high efficiency cycles and short cycles so that both densely distributed and sparsely distributed working capacities can be efficiently protected by the candidate cycles. The algorithm is also flexible in that the number of cycles generated is controlled by an input parameter.

Our text detection algorithm based on maximum gradient difference, allows fast filtering of scan lines without text.

They are NP-hard even in single-channel single-radio (SC-SR) wireless networks when all nodes have uniform (and fixed) interference radii and the positions of all nodes are available. While they admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) when the number of channels is bounded by a constant, such PTAS is quite infeasible practically. Other than the PTAS, all other known approximation algorithms, in both SC-SR wireless networks and MC-MR wireless networks, resorted to solve a polynomial-sized linear program (LP) exactly. The scalability of their running time is fundamentally limited by the general-purposed LP solvers. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of interference costs and prices of a path and explore their relations with the maximum (concurrent) multiflow. Then we develop purely combinatorial approximation algorithms which compute a sequence of least interference-cost routing paths along which the flows are routed. These algorithms are faster and simpler, and achieve nearly the same approximation bounds known in the literature.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847955","","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computers;Interference;Protocols;Schedules;Wireless networks","approximation theory;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;linear programming;radio networks;radiofrequency interference","MC-MR wireless networks;NP-hard problem;combinatorial approximation algorithm;concurrent multiflow;least interference-cost paths;maximum multiflow;multichannel multiradio wireless networks;polynomial-sized linear program;polynomial-time approximation scheme;single-channel single-radio wireless networks;uniform interference radii","","5","","13","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In digital relaying, one of the key issues is that relays might receive in error, resulting in error propagation to the destination. Despite error detection codes can be used to prevent error propagation, performing error detection algorithms incurs delay and processing overhead at relays. An alternative approach is to set a threshold value, whereby the relay forwards when the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds the threshold. Most existing threshold-based relaying schemes implicitly assume the relays are placed in the middle between the source and the destination, whereby a single threshold is applied to the source-relay channel for making the cooperation decision. In infrastructureless wireless networks, relays may be randomly distributed in the network and thus, the relaying scheme based on a single threshold may choose the relay with a weak one-hop channel to forward that degrades diversity combining. In this paper, a threshold digital relaying scheme based on double testing is proposed where both the source-relay and the relay-destination channels are tested to select the cooperating relays. The end-to-end bit error rate (BER) performance is derived theoretically, and compared with simulation results. Different network topologies are considered to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed double testing digital relaying scheme over the single testing schemes.","1550-2252;15502252","978-1-4244-2518-1;9781424425181","978-1-4244-2519-8;9781424425198","10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5493700","","Antennas and propagation;Bit error rate;Detection algorithms;Digital relays;Diversity reception;Propagation delay;Signal to noise ratio;Testing;Transmitting antennas;Wireless networks","antenna arrays;diversity reception;error statistics;telecommunication network topology;wireless channels","cooperative relaying;cooperative wireless networks;double threshold digital relaying;end-to-end bit error rate performance;error detection algorithms;instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio;multiple antennas;network topologies;one-hop channel;relay-destination channels;source-relay channels","","1","","7","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aiming at maximizing this system performance measure, we then optimize an AMC scheme which directly satisfies a prescribed packet loss rate constraint at the data-link layer. The results indicate that utilizing cooperative ARQ as a retransmission strategy, noticeably enhances the spectral efficiency compared with the system that employs AMC alone at the physical layer. Moreover, the proposed adaptive rate cooperative ARQ scheme outperforms the fixed rate counterpart when the transmission modes at the source and relay are chosen based on the channel statistics. This in turn quantifies the possible gain achieved by joint design of AMC and ARQ in wireless relay networks.","2154-0217;21540217","978-1-4244-2488-7;9781424424887","978-1-4244-2489-4;9781424424894","10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4726069","","Automatic repeat request;Cross layer design;Diversity reception;Modulation coding;Physical layer;Protocols;Quality of service;Relays;Statistics;Throughput","adaptive codes;automatic repeat request;channel coding;modulation coding;protocols;radio networks;statistical analysis;wireless channels","channel statistics;cooperative ARQ scheme;cross-layer approach;data link layer;joint adaptive modulation-coding;retransmission strategy;spectral efficiency;truncated automatic repeat request protocol;wireless relay network","","14","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, ActiON uses slot based switching method, so it is difficult to realize the multicast delivery. In this paper, we propose the efficient singlecast / multicast method for ActiON by using PLZT optical switch elements which are controlled as “distribution mode” like an optical splitter by applying mid-control voltage.

AgentFly system has been developed for over five years. It was initially built f or simulation-based validation and comparison of various approaches for autonomous collision avoidance algorithms adopting the free-flight concept. Later, AgentFly has been extended with high-level control algorithms providing tactical control - i.e. coordination of several autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The same agents and algorithms integrated in AgentFly simulation are also deployed on real UAV platforms. Besides this UAV-related application, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) supports the application of the AgentFly system for simulation and evaluation of the future civilian air-traffic management system. AgentFly has been extended with high-fidelity computational models of civilian airplanes and a parallelization concept integrating dynamic load-balancing. The parallelized approach of AgentFly has been validated in simulation using data of a full civilian air-traffic touching NAS.

Makamba province recorded the highest human casualties with 14 deaths and 69 injuries whereas Nyanza-Lac commune of the same province topped the list with 8 deaths and 52 injuries. The statistics do not justify the 1:10 ratio of death : injury as it is reported in USA. The statistics may be a gross underestimation as many lightning accidents are not reported due to lack of communication, especially in the rural areas. Gomes-Kadir equation estimates the death rate as 52 per year, a figure twice as high as that was observed in this study. The analysis of information for incidents over few more years reveals that seeking shelter under ungrounded metal-roofed buildings is extremely dangerous as multiple deaths may occur in the event of a lightning strike to the roof.","","","","10.1109/ICLP.2014.6973323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973323","Burundi;West Africa;deaths;injuries;lightning","Equations;Injuries;Lightning","lightning protection","Burundi;East Africa;Gomes-Kadir equation;Makamba province;Nyanza-Lac commune;USA;human casualties;human death;human survival;injuries;landlocked country;lightning accident;livestock death;statistics;ungrounded metal-roofed building","","1","","19","","","11-18 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the first crucial step of iris recognition, iris segmentation is continuously and widely studied. A novel iris location method, based on rotation average analysis of intensity-inversed image, is presented here for iris segmentation: First, it locates the pupil by checking the consecutive high intensities in the inversed image, and then refines the center with the centroid of the pupil. A rotation average curve of the centered inversed image is thus calculated and segmented to locate the boundaries of iris. Finally, a fast and precise refinement of the outer boundary of iris is carried out. Both self-collected data and certain iris image database were used in the experiments. Compared with conventional methods, this novel method shows faster and robust properties in locating the pupillary and limbus boundaries with higher tolerance of faintness and scaling.","","978-1-4244-4129-7;9781424441297","978-1-4244-4131-0;9781424441310","10.1109/CISP.2009.5301223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5301223","","Biometrics;Detectors;Equations;Fingerprint recognition;Image edge detection;Image processing;Image segmentation;Iris recognition;Transforms;Voting","biometrics (access control);image recognition;image segmentation;reliability","biometric technology;intensity inversed image;iris image database;iris location;iris recognition;iris segmentation;limbus boundaries;pupil centroid;pupillary boundaries;reliability;rotation average analysis","","1","","16","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While Intel has historically incorporated risk assessment and risk management into facility and process design and installation, no analysis existed of the combined risk from the entire facility. A site-wide assessment conducted by an independent third party evaluator, Radian International Incorporated and used inspections, interviews and record checking to evaluate the facility for risk potential based on Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations and guidance. Toxicological review was also done for all manufacturing chemicals. Dispersion and uptake modeling was performed to evaluate risk to surrounding populations. The risk assessment has been used as a communication tool with neighborhood groups, industry counterparts, and regulatory agencies. A summary of key learning, costs and benefits will be presented in the paper.

Experiments using two different techniques to diagnose ISCAS'89/ITC'99 benchmark circuits with/without embedded scan compaction show the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the diagnostic resolution. Impacts on chip performance, embedded scan compaction, transition fault coverage, and test power dissipation are negligible.

In this work we present a fault-oriented test generation (FOTG) algorithm for automated stress testing of multicast protocols. FOTG processes an extended FSM model and uses a mix of forward and backward search techniques. Unlike traditional verification approaches, instead of starting from initial states, FOTG starts from a fault and uses cause-effect relations for automatic topology synthesis then uses backward implication to generate tests. Using FOTG we test various mechanisms commonly employed by multicast routing and validate our results through simulation.","1089-7798;10897798","","","10.1109/LCOMM.2005.1413639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413639","","Automatic testing;Engines;Multicast algorithms;Multicast protocols;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stress;System testing;Topology;Very large scale integration","IP networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;search problems;telecommunication network topology","FOTG algorithm;FSM model;IP multicast routing;automated stress testing;backward search technique;fault-oriented test generation;forward search technique;network simulator;protocol evaluation;topology synthesis;traditional verification approach","","0","","12","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This makes them attractive for applications in which the channel quality is uncertain, where systems transmit as much of a codeword as necessary for decoding to be possible. In particular, rateless codes are potentially attractive for wireless communication. In a recent work, a rateless coding scheme was proposed for the AWGN channel, based on layering, repetition and random dithering. We extend this scheme to multiple-input single-output (MISO) Gaussian channels. We show that the rate loss associated with orthogonal design space-time codes may be alleviated by layering and dithering, very similar to the rateless approach for the AWGN channel. We then combine the two schemes and arrive at a close-to-capacity rateless code for MISO channels. The required complexity depends on the fraction of capacity that is targeted, is linear in the capacity of the channel and does not depend on the number of transmit antennas. Furthermore, the coding scheme uses only one base AWGN code","2157-8095;21578095","0-7803-9151-9;0780391519","","10.1109/ISIT.2005.1523683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523683","","AWGN channels;Broadcasting;Channel capacity;Decoding;Diversity reception;Gaussian channels;History;Legged locomotion;Space time codes;Wireless communication","AWGN channels;channel capacity;space-time codes","AWGN channel;channel capacity;multiple-input single-output Gaussian channels;rateless codes;space-time coding;wireless communication","","5","6","6","","","4-9 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In animal models, multi-point pressure-flow curves can be obtained using an isolated, ventilated, perfused lung system.

The individual vehicle's state of awareness continuously evolves based on the vehicle's motion and is updated at discrete instants whenever the vehicle establishes a communication link with other vehicles. This information sharing update step aids in reducing the amount of redundant coverage. Based on this awareness model, a decentralized control strategy is proposed that guarantees that every point within the task domain will be covered with a satisfactory state of awareness under intermittent communications and/or faulty sensors.

Previous works have suggested that the MRS estimation techniques better measure the nonuniformity due to the underlying spatial function of the process, whereas SRS estimation methods measure the total process nonuniformity (systematic spatial nonuniformity plus random site nonuniformity). This work further highlights this fact in an analytical setting. It is demonstrated that the MRS estimation technique is biased and that this bias can lead to the choice of a nonoptimal process. Experimental data from a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process confirms these observations and demonstrates that careful use of the MRS estimator is required in achieving meaningful results for estimating spatial nonuniformity. Modified versions of each method, which measure spatial nonuniformity alone, as well as versions which measure total nonuniformity, are proposed for the case when one is comparing discrete process settings. Analytical expressions for the expected value and variance of both the SRS and MRS estimators are determined. These are used to compare the efficiency (estimator variance) of these modified estimators. When comparing spatial nonuniformity, it is found that the unbiased MRS estimator is more efficient than the SRS estimator modified to measure spatial nonuniformity. However, it is shown that the MRS estimator, when modified to measure total nonuniformity, is not necessarily more efficient than the SRS method. Finally, the continuous response surface modeling case is considered. It is demonstrated how confidence intervals on the underlying continuous site models lead to a nonuniform bias in the response surface generated by the MRS method. This suggests that care must be taken when using the MRS technique in creating continuous response surfaces of spatial nonuniformity as a function of the process settings","0894-6507;08946507","","","10.1109/66.806119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=806119","","Analysis of variance;Chemical processes;Electronics industry;Helium;Noise measurement;Process control;Response surface methodology;Semiconductor device modeling;Statistical analysis;Virtual manufacturing","chemical mechanical polishing;integrated circuit manufacture;semiconductor process modelling;statistical analysis;surface fitting","chemical-mechanical polishing;confidence intervals;discrete process settings;multiple response surface;random site nonuniformity;response surface modeling;single response surface;spatial nonuniformity;statistical analysis;systematic spatial nonuniformity;total process nonuniformity;underlying spatial function","","5","1","10","","","Nov 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The NDR regime is an inherent feature of all SA-LIGBTs, and results from the two different conduction mechanisms responsible for current flow in the device. These conduction mechanisms are minority-carrier injection and majority-carrier flow. Since both the anode geometry and the doping profile control the onset and the degree of minority-carrier injection, the effect these parameters have on the NDR is investigated. A simple lumped-element equivalent model of the SA-LIGBT allows qualitative predictions to be made on how changes in the device geometry and doping profiles influence the NDR regime. It is shown that conductivity modulation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of negative resistance in SA-LIGBT devices. Also required is a large voltage drop in the high-resistivity drift region before conductivity modulation is initiated. This causes small changes in the anode current level, greatly decreasing the total resistance across the drift region","0018-9383;00189383","","","10.1109/16.85160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=85160","","Anodes;Conductivity;Current-voltage characteristics;Doping profiles;Geometry;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Numerical simulation;Predictive models;Semiconductor process modeling;Solid modeling","equivalent circuits;insulated gate bipolar transistors;minority carriers;negative resistance;power transistors;semiconductor device models","I-V characteristics;NDR regime;anode geometry;conduction mechanisms;conductivity modulation;current-voltage characteristics;doping profile;high-resistivity drift region;lateral IGBT;lateral insulated gate bipolar transistor;lumped-element equivalent model;majority-carrier flow;minority-carrier injection;negative differential resistance;shorted-anode;two-dimensional numerical simulation","","25","","17","","","Jul 1991","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A/W claimed this future 3D animation tool would increasingly serve the artist, not the other way around. Maya addressed a basic problem: When artists working at a drafting table reach for a new pencil, they never look away from the part of the drawing they're working on. Artists at a workstation, on the other hand, must divert their eyes to choose the next tool from a series of nested menus. A/W concluded it should design its next-generation graphical user interface (GUI) around the notion of not forcing the artist to look away from the work area to keep working. One possible solution would organize the menus based on a compass metaphor (North, South, East, and West). Maya 1.0 for Irix was released in January 1998. It kept faith with the GUI promises, but implemented them in a different way: nested menus radiate in a compass layout centered on the current cursor position, allowing the eye to remain on the subject. Maya contains many features from A/W's flagship product, Power Animator, famous for its contributions to Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park among other films. It's both a character animation system and a soft/hard body dynamics environment.

Theoretically, the spectrum of cardiac signals from different leads can be different, and therefore their DF values could also be different. In this study we investigate the effects of lead configuration on the spectrum of cardiac signals. Signals measured by unipolar and bipolar lead systems are synthesized in a simulation environment, and their full spectra, bandwidth (BW) and DF values are analyzed. Our results suggest that the spectral BW and the lead spatial resolution are inversely related. By contrast, DF values are not affected by the lead configuration.

To achieve maximum electrical to optical efficiency in the Q-switched laser we use a side pumped, total internal reflection configuration and an unstable resonator with a uniform reflectivity output coupler. We believe that this is the first demonstration of a solid state laser using an unstable resonator with a uniform reflectivity output coupler or a TIR bounce configuration. Use of the uniform reflectivity output mirror is made possible by the TIR bounce configuration which eliminates all hard apertures within the cavity and thus the need for a graded reflectivity output coupler. This configuration allows for maximum energy extraction efficiency from the oscillator by providing for maximum and automatic overlap between the resonator mode and the stored energy. To date we have demonstrated 40% optical to optical efficiency in the long pulse mode with a flat top transverse profile.","","0-7803-5661-6;0780356616","","10.1109/CLEOPR.1999.811519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=811519","","Diodes;Laser excitation;Optical coupling;Optical pumping;Optical reflection;Optical resonators;Oscillators;Pump lasers;Reflectivity;Solid lasers","Q-switching;laser beams;laser cavity resonators;laser mirrors;laser modes;laser stability;lithium compounds;neodymium;optical couplers;optical pumping;reflectivity;solid lasers;yttrium compounds","LiYF/sub 4/:Nd;Nd:LiYF/sub 4/ laser;Q-switched laser;TIR bounce configuration;automatic overlap;cavity;flat top transverse profile;graded reflectivity output coupler;hard apertures;highly efficient diode-pumped laser;long pulse mode;maximum electrical to optical efficiency;maximum energy extraction efficiency;maximum overlap;optical to optical efficiency;oscillator;resonator mode;side pumped total internal reflection configuration;solid state laser;stored energy;uniform reflectivity output coupler;uniform reflectivity output mirror;unstable resonator","","0","","3","","","Aug. 30 1999-Sept. 3 1999","30 Aug 1999-03 Sep 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The focus of this paper is modeling of a hybrid power system to meet for a USV to meet the mission profiles. The power system of the USV is chosen to be a hybrid power source comprising a diesel generator and a lithium-ion battery pack. Optimal sizing of the diesel generator and battery pack is important for ensuring successful USV missions. This paper describes the characterization and modeling of 70 Ah Kokam cells using fuzzy logic analysis of the experimental data to accurately estimate the SOC, power available and the terminal voltage of this Li-Ion battery.

Recently the presence of free radicals, in particular OH in indoor environments has received an increasing concern. It was reported that the OH radical initiates a complex series of reactions that generate still other radicals and ultimately produce species that can adversely affect human health in indoor environments. We have developed novel atmospheric pressure plasma device that generates atomic hydrogen to neutralize OH radical in indoor air. Device structure and formation of atomic hydrogen in the device have been reported in our previous paper. The purpose of this paper is to report the observation of OH radical reduction with the operation of this device by using spectroscopic and biological methods. Cell protection effects of the device from OH radicals in the air are reported. In the spectroscopic experiments, OH radicals were produced in the air by a dielectric barrier discharge. The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy was employed for monitoring of the OH radical concentration. When the device was operated the OH-LIF intensity was remarkably reduced. In the biological experiments, we compared the cell death rate between cells exposed to reactive oxygen species with or without the device in operation.

At the beginning of a combining procedure, the branch with a larger signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected as in the SC. If the SNR of the branch currently in use is larger than a preset high-threshold, the same branch is continuously used, while branch switching is activated once the SNR is lower than the preset low-threshold. In the meantime, the SC is employed if the used SNR is within the window formed by the two thresholds. With different combinations of threshold values, we can show that the SSC or SC is a special case of this window-based switch/selection combining (WSSC). The outage probability of the WSSC is derived and numerical results obtained from the analysis and simulations are presented for the performance illustration.","","978-1-4244-5015-2;9781424450152","978-1-4244-5016-9;9781424450169","10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383911","","Analytical models;Communication switching;Diversity reception;Fading;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Receiving antennas;Signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Switches","Nakagami channels;diversity reception;probability","correlated Nakagami fading channels;diversity combination;outage probability;selection combining;switch-and-stay combining;window-based selection diversity;window-based switch diversity","","0","","14","","","7-9 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We therefore investigated how Local Motion Sensors (LMSs) [13], [14], comprising only of a few pixels giving 1-D optical flow (OF) measurements could be used to improve automatic parking maneuvers. For this purpose, we developed a low computational- cost method of detecting and tracking a parking spot in real time using 1-D OF measurements around the vehicle as well as the vehicle's longitudinal velocity and steering angle. The algorithm used was composed of 5 processing steps, which will be described here in detail. In this initial report, we will first present some results obtained in a highly simplified 2-D parking simulation performed using Matlab/Simulink software, before giving some preliminary experimental results obtained with the first step in the algorithm in the case of a vehicle equipped with two 6- pixel LMSs. The results of the closed-loop simulation show that up to a certain noise level, the simulated vehicle detected and tracked the parking-spot assessment in real time. The preliminary experimental results show that the average refresh frequency obtained with the LMSs was about 2-3 times higher than that obtained with standard ultrasonic sensors and cameras, and that these LMSs therefore constitute a promising alternative basis for designing new automatic parking systems.","","","","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396901","","Cameras;Optical sensors;Optical variables measurement;Sensor systems;Vehicles;Visualization","computerised instrumentation;flow sensors;mathematics computing;optical sensors;vehicles","Matlab/Simulink software;automatic parking system;bio-inspired 1-D optical flow sensors;closed-loop simulation;noise level;parking spot;vehicle longitudinal velocity;vehicle steering angle","","","","26","","","5-7 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This error of HF power estimation causes, for instance, masking of increased true HF activity during sleep.

The model and keyword discovery methods presented in this paper avoid content analysis, and move towards a generic approach to the identification of relevant interests and, eventually, contacts.

"A Support Vector Machine Approach for Detection and Localization of Transmission Errors Within Standard H.263++ Decoders","R. A. Farrugia; C. J. Debono","Dept. of Commun. & Comput.

The standard codecs employed by these systems remove spatio-temporal redundancies to minimize the bandwidth required. However, this increases the exposure of the system to transmission errors, thus presenting a significant degradation in perceptual quality of the reconstructed video sequences. A number of mechanisms were investigated in the past to make these codecs more robust against transmission errors. Nevertheless, these techniques achieved little success, forcing the transmission to be held at lower bit-error rates (BERs) to guarantee acceptable quality. This paper presents a novel solution to this problem based on the error detection capabilities of the transport protocols to identify potentially corrupted group-of-blocks (GOBs). The algorithm uses a support vector machine (SVM) at its core to localize visually impaired macroblocks (MBs) that require concealment within these GOBs. Hence, this method drastically reduces the region to be concealed compared to state-of-the-art error resilient strategies which assume a packet loss scenario. Testing on a standard H.263++ codec confirms that a significant gain in quality is achieved with error detection rates of 97.8% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gains of up to 5.33 dB. Moreover, most of the undetected errors provide minimal visual artifacts and are thus of little influence to the perceived quality of the reconstructed sequences.","1520-9210;15209210","","","10.1109/TMM.2009.2030651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208238","Error detection and concealment;error resilient coding;learning systems;multimedia communications;video coding;wireless network","","error detection;error statistics;image sequences;multimedia systems;radio networks;standards;support vector machines;transport protocols;video coding","H.263++ decoders;bit-error rates;error detection;group-of-blocks;peak signal-to-noise ratio;perceptual quality;quality-of-experience;standard codecs;support vector machine;transmission errors;transport protocols;video sequences;visually impaired macroblocks;wireless multimedia services","","4","","43","","2009-08-18","Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different from traditional social networks, the links in social media are usually influenced by user references rather than the real world connections, thus the traditional methods based on social network evolvement may fail to reveal the adequate links. Meanwhile, the existing link prediction algorithms considering both social topology and nodes attributes might be too much computationally complex. To deal with these challenges, in this paper, we propose a two steps link prediction framework, in which a filter is functioned to select the candidates firstly, and then the adapted Supervised Random Walk (SRW) is executed to rank the candidates for prediction. Experiments on the real world data set of social media indicate that our framework could effectively and efficiently predict the appropriate links, which outperforms the baselines including ordinary SRW with acceptable margin.","","978-1-4799-2548-3;9781479925483","","10.1109/CIS.2013.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746372","Link Prediction;Social Media;Supervised Random Walk","Feature extraction;History;Measurement;Media;Predictive models;Social network services;Training","social networking (online)","SRW;content-oriented social media services;link prediction algorithms;nodes attributes;prefiltering;social behaviors;social link prediction;social network;social topology;supervised random walk;two steps link prediction framework","","0","","19","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent experimental data on the excitation density dependence of the light yield of inorganic scintillators presents an opportunity to incorporate parameterized interactions between excitations in scintillation models and thus enable more realistic simulations of the nonproportionality of inorganic scintillators. Therefore, a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model of elementary scintillation processes in NaI(Tl) is developed in this paper to simulate the kinetics of scintillation for a range of temperatures and Tl concentrations as well as the scintillation efficiency as a function of excitation density.

In respect to the insufficient extraction of water surface proportion information present in pixels in most of the current water information models, a simple model Enhanced Water Index (EWI) based on Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) has been introduced. EWI, which is oriented toward the sub-pixel level analysis of water surface proportion mapping of inland river basin, has been put forward based on the analysis of typical spectral signatures such as desert, soil, and vegetation along with MNDWI in accordance with the Landsat TM band features. The analysis is done by using methods of pixel-based EWI value with different water proportions which are analyzed through the introduction of the linear hybrid simulation between the water body and the corresponding background. Lastly, the effect of EWI model has been tested in the medium and lower reaches of Tarim. The correction coefficient for sub-pixel level water surface proportion predicted by the EWI model and the experimental data is R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72. Results showed that the model was able to effectively extract the information about pixel water surface proportion in inland river basins.

This paper presents an approach for vocal melody extraction from dual channel Karaoke music audio. The extracted melody corresponds to the singing voice in the original performance channel, which can then be used for melody-based music retrieval. In the proposed technique, audio signals from both the accompaniment channel and the original performance channel are analyzed. The note partials are firstly extracted from the signal, which is represented in constant-Q transform frequency domain. Then the volume balance between the two channels is estimated based on signal approximation in the sub-bands. Finally, the pitch corresponding to the singing voice is identified based on the note partial differences between the two channels. The extracted melody is represented as a sequence of pitch values. This technique assumes that the two channels have similar accompaniment instrument performance except for the singing voices. Experimental result on 40 Karaoke music audios has shown the performance of the proposed technique. The pitch extraction rate is above 70% and melody retrieval accuracy in an 800-tune-database is 90%.","1945-7871;19457871","0-7803-9331-7;0780393317","","10.1109/ICME.2005.1521620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521620","","DVD;Data mining;Frequency domain analysis;Indexing;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Performance analysis;Signal analysis;Signal processing","audio signal processing;electronic music;feature extraction;frequency-domain analysis;information retrieval;music;transforms","audio signal;constant-Q transform;dual channel Karaoke system;frequency domain analysis;melody-based music retrieval;pitch extraction rate;polyphonic music audio;subband signal approximation;vocal melody extraction","","1","","7","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present study we proposed a non-supervised technique based on the steepest descent method with a minimization cost function given by the variance on differences of the linear combination of the electrodes in order to adapt filter's coefficients to the most appropriate spatial filter. Results of applying this technique to electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals of five subjects performing finger flexion task are shown. Adapted filters were compared with Common Average Reference Filter (CAR) when mean square error (MSE) between channels significantly correlated and the power of filtered data was computed; results proved that adapted filters have better performance.

In this paper, the examination in time-domain PPG during passive leg raise (PLR) trial was studied. The 24 subjects pre-experiment resulted that iPRV and HRV are positive correlation (r-value = 0.680±0.099 in baseline; r-value = 0.688±0.096 in PLR). Furthermore, the iPRV containing much complex intrinsic components on higher frequency bands provides more intrinsic cardiovascular information for further assessment.

We establish new theoretical upper bounds on the number of basis images necessary to represent a wide variety of scenes under very general conditions, and perform empirical studies to justify the assumptions.

Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve overtime. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime. We propose a new methodology to associate the novelty patterns detected by the algorithm, in an unsupervised fashion, with the true classes. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology through the use of known novelty detection algorithms with artificial and real data sets.","1041-4347;10414347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2441713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118190","Evaluation methodologies;data streams;evaluation methodology;novelty detection","Context;Data mining;Decision support systems;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty;Time measurement","data mining;matrix algebra;unsupervised learning","artificial data sets;confusion matrix;data stream mining;evaluation measures;evaluation methodology;knowledge extraction;learning systems;multiclass novelty detection algorithms;nonstationary distribution;novelty patterns;real data sets;true classes;unsupervised learning","","0","","47","","2015-06-04","Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To achieve this, vehicles make use of two types of safety messages i) Periodic safety messages (beacons): to exchange status information e.g. position, speed etc. ii) Event-driven messages: broadcast in case of an emergency situations e.g. accidents, hard-braking etc. As both type of messages use same Control Channel, in dense traffic periodic beacons may consume the entire channel bandwidth resulting in a saturated/congested channel. In a congested channel event-driven messages may not be able to access the channel at all, thus providing no safety. Researchers have proposed different strategies to overcome this problem. Most of these strategies rely on the concept of a limiting beacon bandwidth usage level below a specific threshold and thus implicitly reserving a chunk of bandwidth for high priority even-driven messages. In the proposed strategies either transmission rate or power control techniques are used to control congestion. In this paper we evaluate such techniques and highlight following major drawbacks first: using only power control techniques do not satisfy requirements of envisioned beacon-dependent safety applications, second: methods used for measuring channel usage level in transmission rate control technique may not be as effective under real world conditions. We also present a conceptual view of a congestion control scheme using transmission rate and transmission power simultaneously for optimal results.","2155-8973;21558973","978-1-4244-6715-0;9781424467150","","10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5561609","VANET;bandwidth reservation;beacon rate control;congestion control;safety messaging;transmit power control","Driver circuits;Safety","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic","VANET;congestion control;event-driven messages;limiting beacon bandwidth;network traffic;power control techniques;safety messaging;transmission rate control technique;vehicular ad hoc network","","3","1","13","","","15-17 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20020806","1993","","","151","159","MANIFOLD is a coordination language for orchestration of the communications among independent, cooperating processes in a massively parallel or distributed application. The fundamental principle underlying MANIFOLD is the complete separation of computation from communication. This means that in MANIFOLD: computation processes know nothing about their own communication with other processes; and coordinator processes manage the communications among a set of processes, but know nothing about the computation they carry out. This principle leads to more flexible software made out of more re-usable components, and supports open systems. MANIFOLD is a new programming language based on a number of novel concepts. MANIFOLD is about concurrency of cooperation as opposed to the concern of the classical work on concurrency, that deals with concurrency of competition. In order to better understand the fundamentals of this language and its underlying model, we focus on the kernel of a simple sub-language of MANIFOLD, called MINIFOLD","","0-8186-4900-3;0818649003","","10.1109/PMMP.1993.315544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=315544","","Communication system control;Computer languages;Concurrent computing;Investments;Kernel;Open systems;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Problem-solving;Software algorithms","concurrency control;open systems;parallel languages;parallel programming;software reusability","MANIFOLD;MINIFOLD;communications orchestration;computation processes;cooperating processes;coordination language;coordinator processes;distributed application;flexible software;massive parallelism;open systems;programming language;programming model;re-usable components;simple sub-language","","0","","12","","","20-23 Sep 1993","20 Sep 1993-23 Sep 1993","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, Genetic Algorithm (GA) method is used to embed two bits of watermarking data within every pixel of original image and to find the optimal value based on the existing Dual Intermediate Significant Bit (DISB). However, if the two embedded bits is equal to the original bits then this means the watermarked image is still the same as the original one without any changing, while in the other case GA is used getting the minimum fitness value in which the fitness is the absolute value between the pixel and chromosome and the value of chromosome between 0-255.

In general, it is almost impossible to check the fault of all parts, coming from part-feeding system, with only manual inspection because of time limitation. Therefore, most of manual inspection is applied to specific samples, not all coming parts, and manual inspection neither guarantee consistent measuring accuracy nor decrease working time. Thus, in order to improve the measuring speed and accuracy of the inspection, a computer-aided measuring and analysis method is highly needed. In this paper, a computer-vision-based pipe inspection system is proposed, where the front and side-view profiles of three different kinds of pipes, coming from a forming line, are acquired by computer vision. And the edge detection is processed by using Laplace operator. To reduce the vision processing time, modified Hough transform is used with clustering method for straight line detection. And the center points and diameters of inner and outer circle are found to determine eccentricity of the parts. Also, an inspection system has been built so that the data and images of faulted parts are stored as files and transferred to the server.","","1-4244-0426-6;1424404266","1-4244-0427-4;1424404274","10.1109/IFOST.2006.312344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107416","","Automotive engineering;Computer vision;Costs;Flowcharts;Image edge detection;Inspection;Machine vision;Manufacturing automation;Shape;Velocity measurement","Hough transforms;Laplace transforms;computer vision;factory automation;inspection;pipelines","Hough transform;Laplace operator;clustering method;computer-aided analysis method;computer-aided measuring;computer-vision-based pipe inspection system;edge detection;factory automation equipment;manual inspection;measurement system;part-feeding system;straight line detection","","0","","5","","","18-20 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this case beam current may achieve a high value. For example it is reported that the value of electron emission current density of up to 500 A/cm<sup>2</sup> was achieved by this way. Moreover, the repetition rate of electron current pulses of up to 2 MHz was reached. Such serious results predetermine a wide perspective of utilization of the phenomenon of electron emission from the surface of ferroelectrics in vacuum electronics and, in particular, in acceleration and SHF-equipment. But, on our opinion, the possible applications of this phenomenon are not limited by vacuum electronics. We can mention some of them: ignition of gas and gas-fuel mixtures in internal-combustion engines and fire-boxes, ignition of a beam-plasma discharge in plasma-chemical reactors and gaseous lasers, commutation operation of power gas-filled switch. With the help of published data, that refer to the electron emission from the surface of ferroelectrics, we can assume that interesting physical special features are inherent to the aforementioned gas and plasma processes, which distinguish them from similar processes involving electrons, injected by usual electron guns.

Here, it is tested to what degree the detailed modeling could be substituted by a semi-empirical approach to reflect the modules response based on but the information on direct and diffuse irradiance and solar geometry. The model performance is measured by its capability to give the correct monthly mean short-circuit current together with a reasonable R<sup>2</sup> value of the scatter of modeled and measured data.

Ventricular pressure-volume loop analysis is a standard tool to evaluate and quantify the myocardial and cardiac functions. The ventricular volume of transgenic mice is typically estimated by using the conductance catheter measurement system, which measures instantaneous ventricular conductance and then converts it into volume. The classic conductance-to-volume conversion equation was proposed by Baan et al. in 1984, but its accuracy is limited. The volume estimation accuracy of Baan's equation versus different possible mouse left ventricular volume ranges is investigated in this work. The results shows that the error of volume estimation is closely related to end-diastolic volume: the error increases with increasing end-diastolic volume. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to use Baan's equation on the mice with the disease of congestive heart failure, which results in larger end-diastolic volumes.","2324-8475;23248475","978-1-4244-2587-7;9781424425877","","10.1109/CAS-ICTD.2009.4960841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4960841","","Blood;Catheters;Electrodes;Fluid flow measurement;Heart;Mice;Myocardium;Nonlinear equations;Voltage;Volume measurement","biomedical measurement;cardiology;catheters;diseases;genetics;muscle;volume measurement","Baans equation;cardiac function quantification;cardiac gene;classic conductance-to-volume conversion equation;conductance catheter measurement system;congestive heart failure disease;end-diastolic volume;instantaneous ventricular conductance measurement;myocardium;ventricular pressure-volume loop analysis;volume estimation accuracy;volume estimation error","","0","","8","","","28-29 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal in this paper is to find the optimal operating point in the diversity-multiplexing-ARQ tradeoff, with a particular focus on delay sensitive systems. Previous results in this area construct performance measures through the use of high SNR asymptotic approximations. While effective, these approximations tend to trivialize the delay performance of MIMO systems. We present a dynamic programming formulation for finding the optimal diversity gain, multiplexing gain, and ARQ window size, without relying on a high SNR approximation. Our results show that the a delay sensitive system requires one to adapt diversity and multiplexing to the time-requires workload in the system. We provide numerical examples that demonstrate the significant performance gains that can be achieved by choosing an adaptive policy over a static allocation of diversity and multiplexing.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","10.1109/ICC.2006.255014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024355","","Area measurement;Automatic repeat request;Delay effects;Delay systems;Diversity methods;Dynamic programming;MIMO;Performance gain;Protocols;Wireless communication","","","","6","","13","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This setup encompasses the well-studied scenarios of perfect and no channel knowledge at the receiver and allows a smooth transition between these two cases. The data detection performance as a function of the CSI error covariance is analyzed and used to investigate the design of training blocks if such blocks are transmitted to provide CSI to the receiver. Moreover, two approaches to design constellations adapted to the error covariance of the receiver CSI are presented. Whereas the first approach is based on a generic gradient search method, the second approach uses an appropriate combination of constellations designed for perfect and no CSI at the receiver.

When a critical event occurs, an alarm message should be broadcast to the entire network as soon as possible. To prolong the network lifetime, some sleep scheduling methods are always employed in WSNs, resulting in significant broadcasting delay, especially in large scale WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel sleep scheduling method to reduce the delay of alarm broadcasting from any sensor node in WSNs. Specifically, we design two determined traffic paths for the transmission of alarm message, and level-by-level offset based wake-up pattern according to the paths, respectively. When a critical event occurs, an alarm is quickly transmitted along one of the traffic paths to a center node, and then it is immediately broadcast by the center node along another path without collision. Therefore, two of the big contributions are that the broadcasting delay is independent of the density of nodes and its energy consumption is ultra low. Exactly, the upper bound of the broadcasting delay is only 3D+2L, where D is the maximum hop of nodes to the center node, L is the length of sleeping duty cycle, and the unit is the size of time slot. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate these notable performances of the proposed method compared with existing works.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871603","Wireless Sensor Network (WSN);broadcasting delay;critical event monitoring;multichannels.;sleep scheduling","Broadcasting;Charge coupled devices;Delay;Downlink;Monitoring;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","monitoring;scheduling;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","WSN;alarm message;critical event monitoring;energy consumption;level-by-level offset based wake-up pattern;network lifetime;significant broadcasting delay;sleep scheduling method;wireless sensor networks","","7","","12","","2011-06-09","Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, it is important to know the distribution condition of the radicals in the atmospheric pressure plasma. The knowledge in the distribution condition of the radicals in plasma is useful for future application of this type of plasma. In this work, the radicals of Ar atmospheric pressure plasma had been measured. This atmospheric pressure plasma generating device is constructed with a silica glass pipe partially inserted into a copper pipe which is an electric discharge electrode. The exposed silica glass pipe is covered with a copper foil which acts as a grounding electrode. There is 1 mm distance between the electrodes, and 10 kV, 10 kHz voltage is applied to generate dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). In addition, carrier gas Ar is supplied there so the plasma is generated and streamed from the silica glass pipe to the air. This plasma is diagnosed using emission spectroscopy method. The measurements were done in 3 dimensions where x-axis was the horizontal direction and y-axis was the perpendicular direction from the frontal view of the silica glass pipe. The z-axis was the distance from the edge of the silica glass. From the results of the radical distribution measurement, the spatial emission spectrum of Ar, OH, N<sub>2</sub> and O were visualized.","0084-9162;00849162","","","10.1109/CEIDP.2014.6995733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6995733","","Educational institutions;Gold;Plasma measurements;Plasmas","argon;dielectric-barrier discharges;glass;luminescence;plasma diagnostics;plasma jets;plasma materials processing;plasma-wall interactions;surface treatment","Ar;Ar plasma jet stream;SiO<sub>2</sub>;carrier gas;copper foil;copper pipe;dielectric barrier discharge;electric discharge electrode;emission spectroscopy method;exposed silica glass pipe;frequency 10 kHz;grounding electrode;horizontal direction;perpendicular direction;plasma generating device;pressure 1 atm;radical distribution condition;silica glass edge;spatial emission distribution;spatial emission spectrum;surface treatment;voltage 10 kV","","1","","12","","","19-22 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first flush effect is the main impetus for pollutants transportations. This study compared the characteristics of first flush effect on stormwater runoff from blacktop driveway, concrete roof, and roof with grassland. The first flush effects of chemical oxygen demand (COD), Ammonium-Nitrogen (NH<sub>3</sub>-N), Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and Total Phosphorous (TP) were studied through monitoring of rainfall runoff on three different kinds of underlying surface, including bituminous roof, green roof and asphalt road. And four linear relationships for these pollutants were stimulated. The results demonstrated that the first flush effects of these four pollutants on three different kinds of underlying surface presented significantly. Over 80% of pollution load was delivered within the first 40% of the whole runoff period. Thus, retaining the initial runoff could effectively reduce runoff pollution. The linear relationships of four pollutants were presented significantly as well. Most of the correlation coefficients were more than 0.9, which showed that controlling pollution source could significantly diminish pollutants for the similarity of these four pollutants.","","978-1-4244-7737-1;9781424477371","","10.1109/MACE.2010.5536396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5536396","correlation analysis;different kinds of surface;first flush effect;rainfall runoff","Asphalt;Chemicals;Concrete;Monitoring;Roads;Surface contamination;Transportation;Urban pollution;Water pollution;Water storage","hydrology;rain;rivers;water pollution;water quality","ammonium-nitrogen;asphalt road;bituminous roof;blacktop driveway;chemical oxygen demand;concrete roof;correlation coefficient;first flush effect;green roof;nitrate-nitrogen;pollution load;rainfall runoff;runoff pollutant;stormwater runoff;surface water quality;total phosphorous;urban underlying surface;urbanization process","","0","","11","","","26-28 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the Student's-t distribution is unbounded. In many applications, the observed data are digitalized and have bounded support. A new finite multivariate Student's-t mixture model for bounded support data, which includes the GMM and the Student's-t mixture model (SMM) as special cases, is presented in this paper. We propose an extension of the Student's-t distribution in this paper. This new distribution is sufficiently flexible to fit different shapes of observed data, such as non-Gaussian, non-symmetric, and bounded support data. Another advantage of the proposed model is that each of its components can model the observed data with different bounded support regions. In order to estimate the model parameters, previous models represent the Student's-t distributions as an infinite mixture of scaled Gaussians. We propose an alternate approach in order to minimize the higher bound on the data negative log-likelihood function, and directly deal with the Student's-t distribution.","1520-6149;15206149","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6638725","Bayesian estimation;Density estimation;bounded support regions","Computational modeling;Data models;Gaussian distribution;Gaussian mixture model;Robustness;Shape","Gaussian distribution;maximum likelihood estimation;pattern recognition","GMM;bounded support data;data negative log-likelihood function;finite mixture model;multivariate student's-t mixture model;nonGaussian data;nonsymmetric data;observed data;pattern recognition problems;scaled Gaussians;student-t distribution","","0","","13","","","26-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In larger areas, a VTS will generally require a communications system to enable the vessel traffic center and the participating vessels to exchange information. In designing such a system, it is necessary to assess the expected communications loading in order to determine frequency requirements and evaluate alternative configurations for the system. Here, VTS communications are viewed as a queuing system. The customers (messages) arrive at the service facility (communications channel) according to some probabilistic process, and are then serviced (transmitted) according to some other probabilistic process. Queues or waiting lines form as arriving messages wait to be transmitted, because the communications channels are busy. Three classes of messages are considered in the arrival process: check in/check out (basic VTS) messages; Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) messages; and bridge-to-bridge messages. Each class is characterized by an independent Poisson distribution, and the resultant arrival process is a well-defined nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The service time is characterized by a general distribution with a known mean and variance. The queuing results, which are developed, include the utilization factor, the expected waiting time, and the expected number of messages waiting to be transmitted. The arrival process and the queuing results vary according to the time of the day, reflecting the varying traffic load throughout the day. A detailed example is given for a preliminary analysis of New York Harbor VTS communications.","0364-9059;03649059","","","10.1109/JOE.1977.1145349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1145349","","Bridges;Communication channels;Communication networks;Communication system traffic;Frequency;Queueing analysis;Safety;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","","Marine-traffic control;Marine-vehicle communication;Queued communications","","0","","7","","","July 1977","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This newly developed receiver band, along with the existing 250-354 GHz SIS heterodyne receivers, provides dual-polarization observation capability over 320-354 GHz, which cover important C03-2 and HCN5-4 molecular emission lines from the celestial objects. The receiver configuration, including the optics, local oscillator and the receiver cryogenic section, will be described. The measured receiver DSB noise temperature is around 70-140K. The quasi- optical beam characteristics of the receiver module also measured at selected RF frequency to ensure good optics alignment.","","978-1-4244-1885-5;9781424418855","978-1-4244-1886-2;9781424418862","10.1109/GSMM.2008.4534599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534599","","Cryogenics;Frequency measurement;Local oscillators;Noise measurement;Optical beams;Optical mixing;Optical noise;Optical receivers;Stimulated emission;Temperature","radiotelescopes;submillimetre astronomy;submillimetre wave receivers","DSB noise temperature;SIS heterodyne receiver;Taiwan;dual-polarization;frequency 320 GHz to 420 GHz;low-noise heterodyne receiver;quasioptical beam characteristic;submillimeter array","","0","","16","","","21-24 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The films exhibit virtually single domains in the middle of the magnetic cores with magnetization parallel to the easy axis of the films. Around the pattern edge, the magnetization orients along the pattern edge. At the pole tip, the ratio of the edge domain to the pole width increases as the track width becomes narrow. It is important to prevent the enlargement of such a region so as to maintain the permeability at the pole tip. This domain structure remains stable for different magnetization conditions, a necessary condition for readout waveforms without distortions. Thus the films are suitable for magnetic thin-film heads with narrow track widths","0018-9464;00189464","","","10.1109/20.92257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=92257","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Disk recording;Laboratories;Magnetic cores;Magnetic films;Magnetic heads;Magnetic recording;Magnetization;Magnetostriction;Transistors","cobalt alloys;ferromagnetic properties of substances;iron alloys;magnetic cores;magnetic domains;magnetic heads;magnetic thin film devices;magnetic thin films;nickel alloys;palladium alloys;scanning electron microscope examination of materials","CoNiFePd-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> multilayered films;domain structures;edge domain;magnetic cores;magnetic thin-film heads;magnetization;pattern edge;permeability;pole tip;pole width;readout waveforms;spin-polarized SEM;track width","","2","","7","","","Nov 1988","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
