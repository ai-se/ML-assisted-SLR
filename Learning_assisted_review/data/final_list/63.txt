It is the one of the difficulties in the research field of the reliability and security of software engineering to analysis the software defects and predicts the defect distribution in software development process using prediction models. Based on principal component analysis and fuzzy neural network, a new software defect prediction model is introduced in this paper. The proposed model compresses the software defect data using principal component analysis first, and then modifies the activation function parameters of the hidden layer in neural network through the membership matrix, to iterate the fuzzy weights to establish a more reasonable fuzzy neural network prediction model. Finally, the simulation using NASA public data has been made. Simulation results show that the proposed prediction model in this paper has higher robustness, faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower error and other advantages.
